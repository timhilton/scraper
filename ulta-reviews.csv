"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-glow?productId=xlsImpprod16451223","sconey","Maryland",2,"I really wanted to like this. It's a nice formula and seemed pigmented enough. But I felt misled because the images on the Anastasia Instagram showed the shade &quot;Perla&quot; being light enough for very fair skin, which is not the case. I am very fair and when I applied this to my face, in the light - yes it looked beautiful, but when the light shifted I was left with very obvious dark beige streaks on my cheeks. Sadly had to return. Wish they would have made a true white/pearl shade as this is more a champagne/golden shade and much to dark for fair skin."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-glow?productId=xlsImpprod16451223","johnnyfire","ca",4,"i really liked this, it was smooth over my foundation for a cream highlighter.  its very natural looking but I feel like I need to add a powder highlight over it to make it more intense, so I returned it."
