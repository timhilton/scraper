Other parts like my tzone still becomes pretty oily. Other than those makeup stays on fairly good."

SO glad I did because it is nearly identical, and i would say even better at minimizing pores. I wear an argan oil daily moisturizer and even though my skin is dry, I like using this primer afterwards to tone down the shiny moisturizer look. It finishes with a velvety look and feel, and skin looks more smooth and even and feels sooo silky. I bought a velour &quot;puff&quot; from ulta to use instead of the included sponge. I don't wear foundation so can't comment on how it holds up under makeup, but it looks fantastic alone! So very pleased and now I hope Revlon never stops making this!! :-D"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","jess","il",4,"I like this product over my makeup, i do<br />primer, garnier bb cream, and instead of using any powder I actually use this on the middle of forehead, a little on the nose(not to much it will mess up the makeup on your nose) and on my chin, upper lip, and cheeky parts closer to my nose. I like it , gets rid of the shine that is there without looking like i have alot of powder caked on which i allwys hated. so its okay. i dont think you should wear is as primer or all over the face. try it on top o makeup to take away shine or sweat that bothers you. I ee this product as a touch up thing,not a primer. Also i dont use the little sponge that comes with it. I ue my figure get some product lightly dab it on the areas of my face, so that im not moving and taking of the makeup underneath."

So far I haven't had much luck. This product covers with a nice smooth texture, but I haven't been using it long enough to determine if it is sweat proof. My face sweats more than the rest of my body, and when it's this hot, I've found no product that can stand up to the heat."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","AJK","Arizona",2,"Honestly, if you already use a face primer you don't need this product. You can't tell if it is on the brush or your finger so you cannot tell how much you are applying. Then of course you don't know if it's working. I returned it. Don't waste your money."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","Jazzgirl553","Ft. Lauderdale, FL",5,"I use this under a regular foundation to maintain a matte finish and it works very well.  The only negative I've encountered is putting on too much.  But it keeps my oil under control even in the South Florida summer!  Great new product in Revlon's line."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","Reeves621","Tuscaloosa, AL",1,"I have oily skin and have tried several primers and this was by far the worst. The balm actually left my skin oilier and caused my makeup to slide right off. Complete waste of money."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","MKC","New York",5,"I was surprised at how well I like this primer. I have oily/combo skin and this primer really controls the shine in my t-zone, and I even use it under my eyes. It has a smooth texture and mattifies the skin very nicely. One thing, I don't use the sponge that comes with it, it really doesn't work so I apply it with clean fingers."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","Jess","Il",5,"My every day face is moisterizer and a bit of primer to help with redness and shine , but i still get shiny so i use this on my t zone and poof!  No shine anywhere, love it , i use it so much i have to buy a second one  :)  this is great if you dont like wearing too much makeup on you cheeks ect"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","white 20something hot mess","Iowa, US",1,"I used this under my foundation a few times and noticed that when I would go out, without rigorous activity, this stuff made beads of sweat come through the rest of my makeup! I had to repeatedly wipe off beads of sweat from my forehead, chin, and above my upper lip. I have combo skin but i don't think it even matters with this stuff... not to mention it clogs your pores pretty badly, too. don't use this stuff."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","Ash","River Forest, IL",5,"I'm used to liquid primes and this one is more of a  cream and I absolutely love it. It comes with a sponge to apply it. It goes on easily and makes my skin very smooth. I have very oily skin and need a primer that is mattifying and this does a good job. Would definitely recommend this product to everyone."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-anti-shine-balm?productId=xlsImpprod11611023","Alyssa","New Mexico",1,"This works for maybe a half hour but you're even more oily afterwards. It leaves a slick feeling on the skin that's gross and it causes makeup to shift and separate on your skin, leaving you looking blotchy and shiny."
