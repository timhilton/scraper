It didn't last as long as I'd like and felt somewhat sticky. I tried with lip balm under it and it helped. It also help with the moisture. It left my lips stained after I wiped it off.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","azalei898","Chicago, IL",4,"The Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor in HD Infatuation is a very nice, matte, bold, vampy color. The formula is lightweight and non-sticky but I found it to be a little patchy and it did take some work to blend the product evenly. However, if you start with already hydrated lips, the application should be a lot easier and smoother.  <br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Marshall","Dallas, TX",2,"I've never been a huge fan of dark lipcolors, so I wasn't too excited about receiving my Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor in the shade Infatuation. In the bottle it is a deep, deep brown-ish plum shade - one that I would never choose for myself, but was happy to try on, nevertheless. <br /><br />The scent was like all of the other HD Matte Lipcolors - sweet, almost fruity, like candy. I find it pleasant enough, though it is pretty pungent, so I would keep that in mind if you're not a fan of that sort of scent. <br /><br />I swatched it first on my hand, which revealed that it was much more purple than was expected. I had expected more of a brown undertone, but this shade is very much a true, deep plum. <br /><br />It swatched well on the hand, but on the lips was a whole other story. It went on streaky and patchy, a splotchy mess. The more I tried to even it out, the worse it became. And these don't dry down fully, so when I attempted a second coat to try and even it out further, it seemed to just pick back up what I first put down, and just move it around my lips. I had to work very, very carefully to get it to a point where I thought it looked decent - much longer than I would ever want to spend putting on a lip color. Maybe if you had a lip liner in the same shade, and filled in your lips before applying this, it would look okay with one layer, but I don't have a lip liner in this shade, so I couldn't try.<br /><br />Darker lip shades are hard to do right - they are often patchy or streaky (especially purple tones), and , at  least with this shade, Revlon did not manage to pull it off. <br /><br />*This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Sophia","Reading, PA",2,"This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.  To begin this review, let me just say for any prospective buyers that this formula is not long-lasting.  This is due at least in part, I suspect, to the fact that this lipstick never actually dries down on the lips.  Even after a solid 15 minutes of dry time, the lipstick remains rather sticky and very wet.  After half an hour of breathing, sipping water from a straw, and occasionally speaking, the color is mostly gone.  It's good that this a pretty but understated nude shade.  Otherwise, I suspect that the fading would be a much bigger problem than it is.  Seduction is a your lips but better type of nude--that is, it's not really a true nude, but a wearable, everyday kind of pinky color.  I think Seduction best works as a nude for people with light-medium complexions.  Too pale, and this won't really look like a nude at all.  Too dark, and this won't show up too well.  That's another weak spot; if you have very pigmented lips, expect, at the very least. to have your natural lip color more than peeking through.  Overall, for the price, there are better options, even in a drugstore, even if I do think the color is pretty and flattering for certain skintones."

I really liked the gloss applicator.  Unlike many mattes, this one goes on very smoothly and keeps my lips moist, there's not dry tugging.  I also like that I can achieve a precise application, with a dark color like Infatuation, I do no want a messy line.  Infatuation is a perfect color, its a deep berry, almost a stain without the dryness of a stain.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Lhvoyles","Salem, IN",3,"This was pretty much my first ever matte lipstick and I used to think it was really good... until I tried other brands. I will say that it goes on creamy and is semi-moisturizing, but it wears off so easily. It also comes off on cups, straws, food, etc. I am currently wearing one of the shades almost every day simply because it's the only neutral I own. If you wear a shade that is very similar to up your own lip color, it's not that noticeable when it wears off, but the wear is pretty obvious with darker colors. If you want a cheap liquid lipstick that's pretty decent, go for Nyx."

She pointed me toward this one as a more cost efficient substitute and highly recommended it. I said what the heck and went ahead and bought it to try and I have to say I'm disappointed but not surprised. As a consumer of high-end beauty products I'm used to lipsticks with an even application with high pigment and this has neither. I've tried both using it alone, with a base, and mixed with another high quality color but nothing has made a difference. Thumbs down but kudos to Revlon for trying."

The texture is nice, it lasts longer than I expected (&amp; my friend really liked it, including the bold color which she pulls off nicely).

Wish it lasted a little longer, like its sister product, ColorStay Liquid Lipstick. But it still beats traditional lipcolor or glosses.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.<br /><br />While the color I received (Infatuation) is FAR too dark for my skin tone, I still thought this was a great lipcolor.  I love the matte finish and it stayed put for a long time without requiring reapplication.  I did find it to be a bit drying after a while, so I had to apply Vaseline over the top (which then ruined the matte look) but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I'd still consider purchasing in another shade."

Much darker than in used to. Its in liquid form with an applicator and it seems to go on smooth and cover well but being as dark and bold as it is it gives a very dramatic look which would be great for an evening out. For myself that would take a lot of getting used to so I don't see myself using this much due to the color but highly recommend it to those braver than I and looking for that dramatic look. * this review was sponsored by Revlon and crowdtap through a sampling activation.

Usually nude color are either shades too light for my skin tone it makes me look sick or too dark its not good for a natural look or to wear alone. This shade actually matches my lip color. I see it as a nude on the brown side. It has a nice candy. Goes on smoothly. Didn't dry my lips. I found applying it downward on my top lip eliminates streaking and upward on my bottom lip. I like the applicator, its semi rectangular and flat with round top edges. I suggest a nude lip liner to keep it in place. I didn't have any difficulty applying the product. Its definitely matte without the drying of the lips. I really like that its versatile because I have worn it alone and paired it with lip liners of different colors for different looks. To me the color looks slightly lighter than how it looks through the bottle. Recommend to have lips exfoliated before applying.

It makes me feel so confident about myself. I do not normally do bright colours. HD Addiction is bright with a little darkness and edge to it. <br />I wore it all day traveling and without touching it up went to a wedding. Eating, drinking, talking, kissing and more activities and the Ultra HD Matte Lipcolour held up perfectly! I was still receiving compliments by the end of the night. <br />When I first received it, I actually thought it would be my least favourite because of the colour. What a surprise for me! What also first attracted me to the product was the packaging because it is extremely attractive and modern. <br />After holding up so well, I was worried I would have a hard time taking it off but with a makeup remover wipe it came right off without me feeling like I was scrubbing the skin off of my lips. <br />Like I said, I wore it all day and was extremely worried about how dry my lips would be as that is normally a problem. My lips were fine and I was able to wear it the next day with the same confidence and result that I did the first day. <br />I will definitely buy this product in the future as well as this colour. <br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I got the shade HD Glow and I love the color it comes in. It's not too bold yet still vibrant. The scent of the product is pretty strong. It's a sweet smelling almost candy like, but has a hint of plastic-y notes to it. People who are sensitive to scents won't enjoy it but for me, it was fine. I really enjoy the applicator because I don't need more product than what is already on it. It is also a bit pinched in so it hugs the lips a bit. <br />Application wise, the product goes on super smooth and feels almost soft and mousse like. The dry down isn't very matte even though it claims to be. I do notice that if you don't use too much product, it can dry down more matte with some time. My only thing about it is that it can be quite drying on the lips, especially in the winter. Using a lip balm does help but it also weakens the staying power. <br />The staying power of the product is not bad. Depending on whether you are eating and drinking throughout the day, the wear will differ. Also if you are eating something that has oil or grease, it will wear it off more easily. It's easy to reapply, but I personally prefer to remove all or most of it because it can get clumpy. I also notice it can be clumpy if I apply too much at the start too. It would get clumpy in my lip lines, so less is more. Other than that, I really enjoy this product. I only have one shade so I can't tell if they are all consistent with their products, but I would definitely look into trying out other shades.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I do find that they wear away faster than standard liquid lipsticks because these are a more comfortable and less matte formula than most. They took take a while to dry down but once they do they look great! I do find that as they wear, the product gets built up around the lip line, though, which is a bit annoying and doesn't look great. As long as you pay attention to it, you'll be fine.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.  I received this product in shade 610, HD Addiction, to review.  When I saw the color of the product before opening it, I thought it might be a bit brighter than the lip colors I am used to wearing on an everyday basis.  When I applied the product, it was actually even brighter than it looked in the container.  In the container, it looks like a bright rose/medium mauve pink shade, but on my lips, it almost looks closer to red/hot pink.  For me, this shade is good for special occasions or going out as opposed to everyday.  It's a bit too bold for everyday wear.  I like how evenly and smoothly this product goes on, and I was very happy with how long-lasting the color is.  Most lip colors I wear have long vanished by the end of the day, but this product was still going strong.  It actually took me a while to remove it before bed!  I would recommend this product if you are looking for a bright, bold, matte, long-lasting lip product."

I was a bit skeptical of it since matte is hard to get in liquid form of a lip gloss.  Well HD Infatuation is a bit dark purple color to start off, I was amazed how I the color I can pull off, normally I wouldn't think of using this color on my lips. It works great if your having fair skin or light or med . It works best during fall or if your looking for that grunge look back in the mid 90's. The staying power is great, after a few bites it was still on my lips. Works well if you put lip balm on your lips and put HD matte lip on.

And once I got it even, a few hours after it was patchy and uneven again. It took a long time to dry matte too like it was sticky for most part but the thing that I like about it is it didn't dry my lips. Maybe if I have time I'd try this again but if you're the type of person whose always on the go and like eat and drink a lot I don't think this product is going to be perfect for you.

If I have to say about only the color it is good,  but as a whole, the product is not the best. The main issue I face is with it is that the lipstick was really hard to apply, as it is a matte color, I had a hard time applying the lipstick evenly on my lips. And even after the application, my lips became really dry and I had to apply a lip balm after applying the lipstick. So after the 1st time, I always apply lip balm first then apply the lipstick and top it with either a gloss or another layer of lip balm. <br /><br />I received a sample of the product for free to test and try in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."

It really only takes one coat and a little touching up to get a smooth colorful lip! As for the color &quot;Addiction&quot; its a berry color with a little more red overtones, like if you added just a few blueberries to a strawberry shake. Now for me it took a little while to dry to a matte finish but it always seemed still wet underneath. When I would drink or eat something I could see it come off on my cup, food, utensils etc. This is the most disappointing trait since I am used to other matte lipcolors completely drying and not really having to deal with them coming off or having to reapply because my lips look &quot;streaky&quot;. I would have loved to try this in the Infatuation color to see how striking it would be since it's a darker color but, overall Addiction is a good color for those who like pink hues and its an easy application so i would recommend that you try it and have fun!<br />(This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

Any who, I so far have only tried the color Devotion that I purchased from Ulta, and the actual color was very nice and went well with my pale skin and the look that I had put together. My issues is that it started to clump at the back of my lips (where they meet) almost instantly after I applied it. I had to wipe off a lot of excess I guess you would call it. This lipstick definitely does not last through eating either, I was left with a ring of lipstick just around the edges of my lips. I will probably wear it again as it is a nice color, but I would not purchase more of these lip sticks."

I am a lover of lip color and this one make me feel just a little bolder.  It looks great on and really accentuates the shape of my lips.  Because of the bright color and smooth application, it only requires one swipe across the top and bottom to get a flawless finish.  This is my go to for a night out for sure.

It is not sticky and you forget you are even wearing lipstick because is feels so smooth. What is better is that the color lasts for hours. I put it on when I got up, then  realized 5 hours later, although the color had lightened it was still very noticeable and I was impressed by how long lasting it is. It is very rare to find a lipcolor that lasts this long. As long as you are ok with the color fading a bit there is no need to reapply.

The shade is a little too bold for me but I did like the color on me. It's just not something I would wear every day. I would definitely wear this color when I go out for sure. For the most part, I really like this lip color. The formula is really great. I love it. It feels great on my lips. At first I was worried it wouldn't have a matte finish because when I first applied it, it looked kind of shiny. But after about 20 minutes when it set, I did see that it had a matte finish so I was happy. It does have a long wear. I didn't have to reapply for 4 to 5 hours. It keeps my lips moisturized and they do not dry out. This lip color does remove easily with just a cleansing wipe. Overall I really like it. The only reason that I gave it 3 stars is because I didn't think the color went on as evenly as I would have liked. I am going to safely assume it is because it's a darker shade. I had to keep applying color until I got an even look. Other than that, I really liked it.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I quite adore the aesthetically appealing bottling of this product, and the look and/or feel of it.  Although, I will note that this shade was very dark on me, personally, I would have preferred one of the lighter shades.  Also, in the matte variation, I will mention that unlike it's counterpart the Metallic's (of this product), the Matte is hard to spread.  Because of this, the ability to achieve complete coverage and unified tonality is a bit harder then with the other products.  In other words, it glides on thicker than the other products.  I did like the product as whole however, so I will still dub it a whopping five out of five stars.

The colour (kisses) is absolutely gorgeous. It smells like a bakery and I love that smell however it doesn't last long. It's not really matte which is good for me, i like the slight shine. I don't mind reapplying after meals considering I've finally found the perfect colour that doesn't feel tight or drying."

I absolutely love them at Finish I love the natural look to the color and I love the fact that you can build this product with other Revlon lip colors to either help lighten the color dark and a color take down the Shimmer from another color or just completely change up a color I love that it's very buildable with other products from the Revlon line. This is one that I will definitely be going into the store and buying again and I'm looking forward to trying out the other colors in the map collection of the Ultra HD matte lip color I can't wait to see what those look like as well because this is by far my favorite ever tried by Revlon.

The formula was good and not sticky at all; however the color was incredibly patch when applied. Even after two coats the lipstick would not apply evenly and that was really frustrating. Maybe some of the other colors in this collection are better but this shade was too uneven in pigmentation. The applicator was too big as well which made precise application very difficult and the product spread out no matter what I did.

Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the formula of this is!  It's lightly moisturizing and although it's supposed to be a matte lipcolor, it takes quite awhile to actually fully dry down.  The only downside is that the formula can be slightly patchy and during the drying time there's opportunity for transfer but I really like how this feels and it even smells/tastes nice.

I received the lip color in the shade Infatuation. This shade is a rich burgundy plum perfect for the fall season. It is highly pigmented and applies evenly and easily. I love this lipcolor because it is true to the color and long-lasting. The only thing I did not like was the taste of the lip product. Otherwise I was very happy with this lip color."

I find that its a gorgeous &quot;my lips but better&quot; kind of color, as in its almost the exact shade of my lips way described as a rosy pink. The applicator is shaped like a paddle, making it easier to cover your lips in one swipe. As for pigmentation, one dip in the tube was all i needed for full opacity. On initial application, it feels like the NYX soft matte lipcreams or the Colourpop USL, velvety but definitely leaning matte. I found that it became more matte as it dried down. It feels VERY comfortable on the lips. There's a noticeable vanilla frosting kind of scent, but I don't notice it once its on my lips. It outlasted a greasy meal, which so surprised me. Although, with how close it is to my natural lip color it may have worn down a bit. I'm definitely headed out to buy more colors!<br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review."

The bottle feels great in hand, I love the wand applicator, it is easy to apply but it is just too dark for my fair skin, I could never pull this off.

I have use allot of different ones that you are applying again and again throughout the day, this one lasts long and when it starts to wear off, leaves a pretty stain on your lips. I wear masks at work, and you are trying to keep your lips pretty and moisturize, allot of products will stick on your mask or just smear off, this one didn't. I really like this shade, it is a deeper pink shade that makes your lips very pretty, and very noticeable. With it being matte it really looks nice without alot of shine. The applicator is easy to use and apply the right amount of color with or with out a mirror. The holder is just right in your hands and pocket.

It looks great on my yellow skin tone and is super flattering :D The formula is very comfortable to wear on the lips and does not feel too dry. It never really dries all the way and does transfer a tiny bit little by little. It does stain the lips by the end of the day but not too noticeable. Definitely not as long lasting as the metallic matte formula. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

It gave me an extra pop that I needed to feel great and spice up my look, without being too crazy and bold to be distracting.

I have tried Revlon Matte, and when I got the shade HD Addiction, I was happy, because I have wanted to try this shade. The shade is a gorgeous rosy tone against my complexion, and this product is superior to the Revlon Metallic Matte, which I had high hopes for. This product is opaque, and the color is gorgeous. This color is a keeper for me.  Compared to the Metallic Matte, the Matte without Metallic is amazing."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Jorji","Chicago, IL",4,"This product is unlike any other liquid matte I have encountered thus far, it goes on as a semi glossy gel and dries down to a petal soft matte. It is not completely transfer proof but it is long wearing and the brighter colors leave behind a stain that helps increase the wear time. It is amazingly comfortable on the lips and the colors that I have tried are gorgeous. This formula seems to be a really winner for summer/spring brights - it is more comfortable than a traditional liquid lipstick but moves around less than a typical lipstick making it that perfect compromise to use with bright colors that you want to be comfortable and to not budge. It applies best if you use only a thin layer of the product, too much and it won't dry down properly. My one complaint is that Revlon is not cruelty free!"

No surprises, except for how much I was going to like it. Big color pay off. I wear mine weekly. --It does say ULTRA HD MATTE.. the only thing with that is.. it says it gives a &quot;glossy finish&quot; and it does, while also drying down to some sort of matte.. don't buy it just for the matte, buy it for the color."

I have about 5 shades, try in store first! Some colors are depicted different than on lips from online.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Wolf Girl","FL",3,"This lipstick is okay: it's okay for what it is. It's your average liquid lipstick with a nice range of colors. However, it does have some down sides to it that deter me from a regular use. It is streaky when applying, almost like a lip gloss. It even appears to be a tinted lip gloss until it finally dries up to an hour after application. Until then, it is stick and is easy to come off. I had a cigarette about fifteen minutes after application and you could tell exactly where it touched my lips. Not to say you'll be smoking (don't do it), but you get my point. Once it does dry, it wears off a lot. I have the color Love which is a very bright, vivid red and a few hours later it had faded to more of a coral color. However, even with all of these things, I still like it. For a tinted lip gloss, it's perfect. I like lip glosses  like this, so I still like it. It also has a brush that makes it very easy to draw out the details, but if you are looking for an opaque, quick-drying, full-on matte lipstick, just look elsewhere."

Through a whole night of drinking, dancing, and kissing it stayed in place. I ended the night hugging the toilet, but on my way out of the bar I checked my makeup and would you believe my lipstick was still on fleek?"

The photo on the display made the color appear as an earthy tone that I fell in love  with.  I went out of my way to go to Ulta to purchase it.  When I got home and tested it I was very disappointed to see that the color was more red than natural champagne/beige tone.  I was planning on keeping it but realized the color just isn't me and will return it if allowed."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Maria W.","Raleigh, NC",4,"This lipstick is very pleasant overall. It applies like a gloss, which is strange considering it's marketed as matte. It does *eventually* dry down to a mostly-matte finish, but it takes a while. The formula is really unique. It's very silky-feeling, almost like some kind of gel, but doesn't feel sticky or gloppy like a gloss, or slippery like it's going to slide all over your face. It's not drying or heavy feeling. It's also nice and opaque and goes on smoothly. It has a faint, sweet, fruity taste, and a rather strong smell like a LipSmackers gloss (which I personally like), but the smell basically disappears once it's applied. I have the color Kisses, which is a nice nude-y berry on my fair skin tone. Though it isn't a liquid-to-matte lipstick like the marketing implies, it's a really nice product."

I goes on very smooth, almost glossy for about 5-10 min and then it turns matte. The formula has a vanilla-y smell and it doesnt dry out your lips! Mine stayed on all day (Im a very sporty person and I have multiple sports practices during the school day and after school) and was moisturizing for the entire time if I put chapstick under it. You can easily wear it without any chaptick on your lips and it will be completely fine! I bought Passion, and Romance and if I acudentally wiped my lips on my shirt or something, it didnt come off. It's a very vibrant color and probably worth more than 9 dollars. It stays on better than my Too Faced Matte lipstick (in drop dead red). I would totally reccomend this product! Although I would like for it to be in darker colors rather than mostly bright reds and pinks. Also they have alot of great nude selections for people of African decsent! (It's actually nude!)"

So since I love a good liquid to matte lipstick, I was excited to finally try one!<br /><br />Sadly, even though I've had a great experience with most of their other types of makeup, this was subpar at best. <br /><br />Pros: Smells great, tastes great, has some great classic colors that I think would look good on all skin tones, doesn't feather out (no lip liner needed), decent applicator<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't dry matte, and it comes off so easily that I didn't even want to try and blot it matte, because I feared I'd end up with no lipstick on after that. The color I got was close to my own lip shade, so it was less noticeable that didn't stay on my lips than had I got a bolder color, which is my usual preference.<br /><br />Now, if you go into this product with typical lipstick expectations (will need touch ups, will transfer, etc) than it's not a bad product. But it definitely doesn't live up to it's fellow liquid to matte lipsticks in the typical aspects we come to associate with this type of product."

I bought two shades, one light and one dark to add to my collection of matte lipsticks. This product is not matte at all. I bought the lighter color in seduction which since it was light, the streakiness was less noticeable but it still did not dry down to a matte lip. The darker color was in infatuation and this specific lipstick was HORRIBLE. The worst I've ever tried. In the bottle the color is really pretty, but once you put it on it is so streaky that it looks ridiculous and it also never dries down to a liquid lip but thank god in this case because it would be horrendous.

That is what this is but...it isn't really matte. I wanted a matte lip color because it works best if you are dancing. Especially for pom dances because accidents have happened many times where you get hit in the face with a pom and your lipstick smudges. I was expecting a matte product. It looks matte from a distance but it constantly feels wet and doesn't sink into your lips. I tested this at home before a performance to see if it was good. I waited several hours and it never dried matte. I hated this product so much that I threw it away.  Why a high price (for the drugstore it is kinda pricey) for such a terrible product. It also smells like children's medicine. It is a great color and I am very disappointed. If I could I would give it zero stars."

For nights out when I have more time to get ready I do a lip scrub and lip mask, apply chap stick, and put the matte lip on clean lips. It dries somewhat quick and looks nice with gloss over it. "

She said this is even better than her Urban Decay!"

It is not drying at all, doesn't fade even through a cup of coffee, smells great, and is easy to apply. I have Seduction and Forever. I just wish there were more colors!

I could eat, drink, kiss without having to reapply. The formula is matte but it's not drying, it still has a slight shine to it. And the price is affordable, too."

Being a matte, I expected it to dry quicker. Due to the long drying time, the staying power was mediocre. However, once it did dry it became almost a stain, which is originally when I was looking for. I didn't keep this product for two reasons: 1) the drying time; 2) it continued to smear on my teeth. <br /><br />The price is great and I recommend it for those of you who don't mind reapplying product throughout the day and being concerned with it transferring onto your teeth."

The nuetral shade, was not true to the colour i assumed i was getting at all (it was much more tawny then pinkish nude) but other than that it was a great pick. The pinks application was not even, pigmentation was moderate, and it lasted very a short while. So all in all, it can be a great product if you're willing to take the gamble."

I tried a lip primer, exfoliating my lips, multiple layers of the gloss, using a brush to smooth it out, a different product over the top....nothing worked.

It's not a true matte finish but has a nice velvety feel. The color selection is nice for a drugstore brand but I would KILL for some more colors. It smells really pleasant too, somewhere between a vanilla and a fruit smell. I'm definitely working on getting all the colors."

Not enough product comes out on the wand so it takes around 4-5 dips just to get even coverage.

I've used the brand Mars lipstick but I have to say Revlon matte lip gloss is the best. I apply it on everyday around 7 am before I leave the house and by 7 pm when I get home it's still on. Now you must know I am eating in between these hours and drinking and it still doesn't come off. One thing I like about this lip gloss is that it doesn't dry out your lips and it doesn't smear. I can forget I'm even wearing it and touch my lips and nothing goes on my hands. I really love this brand and I love how it comes in so many good colors next all they need is maroon"

Wasn't sure if I'd like the color devotion, but it's gorgeous. I do have to blot my lips for it to look true matte. I love the doe foot applicator.

I havee too takee some off so it can dry down properly, which defeats the purpose since i have to add quite a bit to get an even application. I don't have to do that to any of my liquid lipsticks.

I'm not convinced revlon knows that matte means it doesn't have a shiny or glossy finish. It must be applied quite thickly to get the color to match how it's supposed to look.

Swatched on the hand there is a slight difference (Forever is slightly browner and Seduction is pinker), but I put one on the top lip and one on the bottom and I can't tell at all.

From what I hear it is not as drying as a lot of matte colors but this still dries me out quite a bit. My biggest complaint is that the darker colors go on really unevenly and smudge and transfer like crazy. As someone who is by no means an expert at doing my makeup and who often is applying on the go, this can be really annoying."

After about 10-15 minutes, the lipstick was basically balling up on my lips, and parts were coming off, and it just wasn't a cute look. And don't expect a liquid lipstick that will dry matte.

It was one of the first lipsticks I started wearing casually (not just for special occasions), and I love it. Applies more easily than many liquid/ gel lipsticks because it's a fairly thick, non-sticky formula. Most colors go on opaque and any streakiness can be fixed with a little more attention with the doe-foot. If your lips are moisturized and exfoliated, this wears really nicely. Not matte until later in wear (at least 30 minutes in, varies by shade), but shine is subtle and you can tap the surface with your fingers or blot lightly to reduce it. Comfortable, doesn't dry out the lips much, and when it does fade, it does so in a pretty graceful way. Definitely not going to look flawless forever or last through eating a burger, but I feel confident when I wear it that I don't look like a doofus. It reapplies fairly well over previous layers. One mistake I made was wearing it on sunburned lips. It looked pretty bad by the end of the night, but I think anything would have. The price point also means I can buy colors that are out of my comfort zone, so it's really helped me explore lipstick wear."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Ms. Matte","Greenville, NC",4,"I bought the color Kisses and it's just as it looks in the bottle. However, this is NOT matte like it's advertised. Also, it has a very strong sweet smell like a kid's lip gloss and is tacky. Great pigment, applies easily, and it doesn't need re-applying throughout the day unless you like a thicker coat."

I only have one right now but that is changing as soon as I can get to the store to buy more. Hydrating, long-wearing, smooth application, even color application across lips, transfers but is still opaque on lips, so a little pro and con there. Can't beat the price. I bought the color kisses and I find it to look similar to Kylie's Candy K. In love with this product."

I bought Passion first and loved it so much that I went back for Love and Devotion and later picked up Seduction as well. Honestly, I will probably own them all eventually because I have terrible self control. The colors are all so pigmented and perfect and these dry matte and last so long. Just buy them!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","EastLansingMom","East Lansing, MI",4,"I enjoy this product for every day wear as well as going out. These apply evenly and they layer well when you need to touch up. Very comfortable to wear. I don't find them to be particularly long wearing, but they wear longer when used with a lipliner and allowed to dry down for a few minutes before eating/drinking. They also seem to fade evenly. The nude shade Seduction is perfect and I also bought Obsession which I have been wearing with everything. When dried down, the matte finish is beautiful, and I also like wearing these with a gloss on top. Overall very happy with these, especially for the price. Deducted one star because you have to apply a very thin coat -- occassionally I get lazy and don't wipe off the applicator fully before applying, and have to spend a lot of time cleaning up the line around my lips."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Hayley","VEGAS",4,"I. Love. These. These liquid lipsticks have become my new favorite lip product!!! Before these I tried the also recently released Maybelline Vivid Matte liquid lipsticks, as well as the Loreal Pro Matte Gloss liquid lipsticks, both of which I read good reviews for on beauty blogs, but I didn't care for those. They were to drying and just meh. But these I love because they are NOT drying like a lot of liquid lipsticks are! Not at all! They look and feel very moisturizing, and I feel like they even make my lips appear much fuller and plumper. I LOVE the bright vivid shades, however I do wish they had a few more neutral shades in the bunch. These last FOR HOURS, however when it's time to take them off, they come off easily with a makeup wipe. I love the fragrance, but some people might not. I'm taking off a star simply because these claim to have a matte finish, and much like the Maybelline version, they are not. They have a bit of a glossy sheen to them, but it's pretty and makes your lips look fuller!"

Recently I saw a new display that had this one color called Kisses that screamed my name. It reminds me of NYX's soft matte lip creme in Rome except Rome is RIDICULOUSLY patchy. I put up with it anyway cause i love the color. Anyways, so I bought Kisses and I must say I have very low expectations. No, it doesn't dry matte. I'd describe this to be a super opaque lip gloss without too much shine..if that makes sense. It goes on so evenly, the color is so rich, it smells great, the applicator is nice. Its super comfortable on the lips...but it never really dries. You can rub your lips together and spread the color around for hours. So yah, if you're going for a &quot;liquid lipstick&quot; stick to Stila or Anastasia Beverly Hills...I have yet to find a drugstore &quot;liquid lipstick&quot;...but if youre going for a great comfortable lipsticky/opaque lip gloss kinda item, GET KISSES. I think you'll be as pleased as me."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Sari","Kansas City, MO",5,"You cannot beat the price on this liquid lipstick. I love Revlon lip products and have been using their lip pencils and lip butters for years. The lipstick goes on smoothly and is deeply pigmented. A great pro is that it doesn't dry super fast (like Stila, another brand I wear and love) so you have a few moments to fix any smudges. The downside to that is it doesn't dry completely so it does tend to wear off somewhat quickly (such as after drinking) but it's really not an inconvenience. It is a bit drying, so I recommend keeping up on daily moisturizing. What I usually do is slather on some lip balm (Burts Bees or something similar) then let it sit for about half an hour, then blot off the excess so the liquid lipstick can set on your lips and isn't floating on a thick layer of chapstick."

I would say it lasts a couple of hours before it really starts to wear off but when it does, it does so evenly so it doesn't look gross or patchy. It doesn't really dry down to a matte, but I was expecting that as I've heard that from other people. I definitely want to check out some other colors."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Kendall P","Houston, TX",4,"I bought this lipstick in Devotion and Seduction and I am absolutely in love with the colors. This product applies very evenly and is more on the creamy side. The only con I have noticed is that if you touch your lips to anything it comes right off. Besides that, this is one of the best matte liquid lipsticks I have found and they are very affordable. It is also the only one I have found where your lips are still smooth after application. It feels more like you are wearing a chapstick than a matte product, which is usually very drying."

The color (devotion) is nice but it makes my lips peel the day after I wear it. I actually returned one and kept one.  I would recommend trying it because you may not have the same reaction I do when using. It's good but not for me."

That shade doesn't wash me out, still defines my lips, and is neutral enough for everyday wear. Dries to matte pretty quickly, and it lasts very well too. (Then, of course, when it does begin to fade, it's not horribly noticeable because of the nude color, and seems to leave behind a slight stain.) Overall very impressed with this product and happy with the price point. Revlon seems to consistently have lip products nailed. Smells nice too!"

I love the comfortable gel-like formula which feels really hydrating on the lips. It dries down to a satin matte and stays comfortable on the lips all day. It isn't drying at all like most matte lip products because it doesn't dry down completely. These won't stick to your lips like a liquid lipstick, so it can smear or move around if you eat or drink. It applies really well and is highly pigmented. The doe foot applicator is a nice size and shape for applying this to the corners of the lips. The only downside for me is the smell which is a weird fake chemically fruit smell, but luckily this quickly dissipates and isn't bothersome."

I'm always crossing my fingers when it comes to drugstore products cause nothing compares to finding an affordable winner! Unfortunately, this is was a disappointment. I got the color devotion and the application itself was superrrr patchy...I tried being patient and layering it but nothing seemed to work. Ended up having a weird finish as well..which was anything but matte. The packaging was nice...and the applicator was great too! Unfortunately the formula itself is the reason I'll be passing on this."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","ChickenEnthusiast","Texas",4,"I bought it [HD Love] after recently finding out I like a really bold red lip on myself. It applies nicely and feels really good to wear. I'm currently wearing it around the house just to test it out and it feels almost like a second skin. It doesn't feel drying at all and I feel no need to constantly rub my lips together, and this is coming from someone who always carries a tube of chapstick and asks for said chapstick as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it bleeds a little and it is sort of difficult to apply. Though this application difficulty might just be because of my inexperience with lipsticks/stains of the sort. Also, it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (there was no price indicator on these guys for some reason). It also isn't as matte as I thought it would be, but honestly, that doesn't bother me too much and I still love it to pieces. Either way, I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good lip color!"

First the packaging is nice , you can apply it with very ease and its true to color.I applied it at 8am before leaving for work and had it untill 7pm without any re-touch and once I was home washed it off. So no touch ups needed, it didn't bleed, it has matte affect without making it dry and doesn't get greasy as other lipsticks tend to in summer. I am planning to buy more colors in it ."

I'm very fair, and I've purchased so many lip products that end up being too dark to be &quot;nude&quot; or too light and end up making me look like a zombie. This color hits the nail on the head, so if you're fair I highly suggest this. Also, this product has an almost whipped texture that feels comfortable on the lips. If you apply too much, it won't look matte, but it's easy to correct with a little blotting. The only downside is the very strong fragrance which is a generic, sickly sweet scent. I only notice it while applying though, so I can live with it."

I was a little weary when I tried this one out, because I'm very fair and the nude colors I've tried in the past come out a little too brown when I have naturally rosy lips. This one is incredible though! It's slightly orange-y, but I found it compliments my coloring very nicely, and it stays ridiculously well! Seriously, you have to be intentionally trying to get it off for it to start to wear away. The only criticism I have is that it's pretty drying. By the end of my time wearing it, I'm always reaching for some lip moisturizer. Perfect for its intended purpose, though: neutral and great for any outfit, day or night."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","don","seattle",5,"I've been doing a matte lip for years - usually in lipstick form. This was the first 'gloss-type applicator' that I tried and love how it's not as drying as traditional matte lipsticks and feels very moisturizing without sacrificing the matte part. I bought the color 'Addiction' after seeing it in a magazine ad and was pleased with how true to color that it was."

Once you apply, it will need to have about 15 minutes to become completely matte. It is worth the wait though. If you want to see how each shade will work on your skin go over to revlons website and they show each shade on different skin tones. Definitely will repurchase"

I love the color and how it looks and it applies evenly. However, like other reviewers said it does dry out your lips a bit. I normally just put on chapstick once the glass has dried. I like the color and use it almost everyday, but I don't think I would buy it again just because it dries out my lips."

It goes on matte &amp; takes about 5 to 10 minutes to finally reach that full matte coverage but the wait is extremely worth it. I got it in the shade &quot;Flirtation&quot; which goes on as such a pretty coral pink! It does feel a little dry and seems to crease in between the fine lines on my lips but other than that I'd have to say I'm quite satisfied with the product and would buy from this line again!"

That's important to me because I love food. It doesn't quite pass a kiss test, but it has a really lovely color. Also, the shape of the applicator is really nice and makes it very easy to apply evenly. It doesn't dry quickly, so it may not appear matte at first, but a few blots with a tissue make it a fairly lovely matte."

I have really fair skin, so nudes can be a bit hit or miss on me. However, Seduction is beautiful. I've been either wearing it or switching to it every day since I purchased it. It's a great color. I like the formula. It's not going to last all day necessarily, but it doesn't fade weirdly, so that's OK. When I purchased it, I was a little worried that the color would look weird on me, but it looks pretty fantastic. I would put it in a &quot;your lips but better&quot; category, but less pink than most of those that I've tried in the past."

I don't like that there are many colors in this line. I also don't like that this color doesn't work for my skin tone without other make-up on. But that is my fault. The color kind of just fades into my skin tone. I like that it's matte because it means it last just a bit longer than a creamy or glossy formula does."

I love the smell of this product...it smells like lemon cake. And that's about the only pros of it...The application is extremely patchy. I had to use several coats just to get an even application on my lips. At first, it feels very comfortable but once it dries down it is EXTREMELY drying. I don't mind lip products that feel drying, but I glanced in the mirror and this made my lips look awful. It accentuated all my lines and began to wear off unevenly. I really want to love this because the color is soooo beautiful, but sadly this is a dud."

It is very hard to find a good drugstore liquid-to-matte lipstick, so if you see these go ahead and grab a few. Yes, they are drying, but that is a small price to pay for the beautiful color payoff. A few tips: blot with a tissue for less drying, gently lick the lipstick (remember: gently) to make it turn matte more quickly."

Some colors are not true to the swatch or packaging but that wasn't a big deal to me as others were, I just figured they looked different with my coloring."

I am a sucker for a matte lip, so I was really excited to try this out. However, I was disappointed immediately when I put it on and it came out with an orange hue that wasn't close to the color swatch or color of the tube. Also, it never dries to a matte finish. I left it on for over 20 minutes just to see, and all I had was a tacky glossy mess. It does not apply evenly or dry to any kind of matte finish, and it transfers onto EVERYTHING. I hated this so much I returned it less than 12 hours later. I will not be trying any other shades after this experience."

I've tried at least 7 brands from drugstore to high end and these are the most comfortable yet long wearing lippie. It's not a matte finish but it's more satin looking. The smell is about a medium intensity but it's not nasty. The packaging is a little outdated with only the top reminding me of the early 2000's, but the frosted bottom is modern. There are great colors and they last for at least 6 hours. When they fade it looks like a even wash of color all over without looking like you need to apply something on your lips."

It is as long as you don't glob it on. The color is very rich so non need to. It left my lips only a little dry but I'm addicted to chapstick so that isn't an entirely fair assessment. I was only rarely reminded I had it on. The best part is it lasted all night with no need to reapply. I enjoyed dinner, drinks, and dancing and it went the distance. Great product."

A few days later I decided to see how it was long-wearing, and was so happy to see that it turns into an excellent matte lip color. If you're looking for a matte lip color right away, you'd want to go for a quick matte lipstick, but if you have a bit of time before you need to be anywhere, definitely put this on. It starts a bit glossy but it does turn into a very matte lip color with great color payoff. I wore mine for longer than a five-hour shift at work and it still lasted long into the time afterwards. It isn't drying and it feels really nice, and there is a sweeter smell when it's first applied but I really like it. I'm so glad it paid off."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Carli","Houston, TX",5,"I have a tendency to shy away from matte lipsticks because they tend to feel very uncomfortable on my lips. That is NOT the case with this lipstick. It's very comfortable and downright moisturizing. Furthermore, I'm VERY picky about the scent of lip products and I quite enjoy the scent of this lipstick. The applicator is very effective and easy to use. The payoff is great and not patchy. It lasts slightly longer than your average lipstick and about as long as I've had wear from other liquid lipsticks. I've already gone back and purchased other colors."

First off, the color is awful - it reminded me of calamine lotion (the stuff our moms would put on our bug bites), and the texture reminded me of cake batter. Don't bother with this one. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Lilly","Pennsylvania",5,"This product is amazing! Matte is always something that I have loved but need to steer clear of because it is so drying. Not this product though! This product goes on like a shiny lipgloss and dries looking like a matte lipstick. However, when the product dries on the lips it does not look dry or cracked. This product also wears extremely well. I am able to apply it in the morning and have it last through most meals and drinks throughout the day. I look forward to purchasing this product in other colors!"

It is longlasting but if you were to put your lip to a cup some product would come off. Yet you would not need to retouch your lipstick.<br />I would definately buy the other colors "

It was still super glossy, and when you apply it on, the colour texture was not quite even. But on the positive side, they do have a good amount of different colours."

Thos formula stays wet and slides while you wear it. Its a pretty color, but it doesnt completely dry. If you're looking for an actual liquid to matte brand, try something else."

It's long-lasting and keeps its color throughout the day with minimal reapplication. If you have dry lips, I'd advice to moisturize them before applying this product. It isn't as dry as other matte products, which could be good and bad. Good because your lips won't be dry, bad because it still has a little wet look. Overall, I love it and I already own two of these bad boys."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Blonde beauty","Atlanta,  GA",4,"I love the color and consistency of this product but it doesn't dry matte. I would say it it more like a demi-matte because it isn't shiny but it certainly isn't full matte. The packaging is nice and I like the applicator a lot. I hope they make these in more colors."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Selena","Phoenix",3,"This is not matte at all. It's a very glossy finish that never truly dries down. It transfers like crazy. I'm not impressed with the color range. It's okay, but I will not be purchasing any more."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Aliss","CA",4,"I tried this and the Maybelline ones that came out recently and they're pretty similar. I got a nude, a red and a berry in the Revlon and a berry and fuschia in the Maybelline. There are products that are more matte, but on me these do dry sufficiently matte/satin finish. What I love about these is how lightweight they are and how they're not too drying! I have dry everything and love a matte lip and it's been great to see improvements in formulae for lip products! I was delighted to find these at the drugstore as they were readily available, I could see the colors, returnable, sales etc... They're so lightweight I feel like I have nothing on, but then catch myself in the mirror, and whoa, pigmented lip product on my lips that I don't feel! I'm so glad matte lips are becoming more comfortable to sport and this product is among those I reach for often. The packaging is pleasing to the eye and nice to hold but too bulky and they don't fit into my makeup organizers' lipstick/gloss compartments. There is also a noticable smell if you are extremely sensitive. I highly recommend giving these a try."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Beauty","Florida",4,"So I love this! It last longer than you would expect. It goes on glossy at first but once it dries it turns matte. I think the applicator works great! It smells great and has an opaque finish and the colors are bright and beautiful. The only thing I don't like is that it dries my lips out. I usually put a lip balm before I put lipstick on because my lips are sensitive and I can't do that with this matte lip. It clumps up and looks all weird. I can't wear this stuff often because of that reason. I will be buying more shades though because the colors and packaging are so pretty!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Annie","Oregon",3,"I bought this in Passion and Love. Both were lovely (Passion is a pretty berry color and Love is a bright cherry red) but neither were really very matte. I've been using these blended in with some lip balm which makes these turn into a great lip stain. The applicator sucks but if you're going to blend it with some lip balm, you really only need the applicator for dotting this on the lips (blend with a lip brush or your finger)."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Annie","Long Island, NY",4,"I heard about this lipstick and wanted to try it out; also at Ulta they had a buy one get one half off of Revlon so I decided to try it then when I got the Colorstay foundation.  When I first opened and tried it on quickly in the car I was like oh great another throw away lipstick but then I tried on the next day properly with a little foundation and eye makeup and I love it. I have the shade &quot;seduction&quot; and it really is the perfect nude.  I would recommend to wear two coats, applying the first, wait for it to dry and apply a second coat."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Bri","Saint Paul, MN",4,"I have only purchased the shade Addiction, and I love it. For the price, you can't beat it. I was leery at first because they are so inexpensive but I love that the color has lasted as it do for me. I Applied at 6am and had breakfast and juice and it was still on. I lightly reapplied after lunch at 1pm just to bring back the intensity, But for the price I can't complain. Definitely will purchase some other shades as well."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","Deisy Meza","Alamo, TN",5,"I just purchased this product in the color seduction. I dries down to a semi-matte I would say. It's very long lasting. I can smile without it cracking. It doesn't crumble. I cannot wait to try out the other colors. Definitely a great product if you have a long day ahead!! Very satisfied!! I only wish they had a wider color selection or maybe I haven't seen the other colors they have. This product is a must try!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod13541029","JenTheRedheadMUA","Chicago",2,"I mean, you get what you pay for. I'm a make up artist who's used to ABH, Stila and Lime Crime liquid lipsticks that dry down to a nice velvety matte finish. Revlon missed the mark on this. It's very sticky feeling, and does NOT dry matte. The colors are incredible and super pigmented, but they're glossy. Also, the applicator is super weird in my opinion... It doesn't pick up the product in the tube very well, and is awkward to smooth on to your lips evenly. It's not a bad product, it's just not what it claims to be.<br /><br />Overview for &quot;Obsession&quot; (hot pink):<br />Color: Fabulous.<br />Pigmentation: A+<br />Scent: Somewhat pleasant<br />Taste: Gross, chemical-y. Don't get it in your mouth.<br />Finish: Creamy and glossy. Messy, tranfers to everything if you're not careful.<br />Longevity: Lasted me 1 solid hour before fading completely.<br />Applicator: Weird, not my favorite design.<br />Packaging: Classy and stylish, reminiscent of Marc Jacobs cosmetics packaging,<br />Other: Makes a pretty decent cream cheek tint.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for a matte lip, this one is not your bff. If you want super bright, creamy, shiny lips, I would definitely recommend this."

Its supposed to be a light nude but the one i got is completely different. Its redish orange and it makes my teeth yellow. Ive looked on the package millions of times and sure enough everytime it says seduction. Im si sad because the real seduction looks like such a pretty color."

So I got the shade 'Seduction' because it seemed like an everyday shade, which is definitely is. I think unfortunately you get what you pay for. It never dries down to a matte, it wears off pretty quickly, and I need to apply a lot of coats to get even application. I was pretty disappointed honestly, but I'll still keep it to have a basic shade I can throw on before a meeting at work."

Even through eating and drinking, the color was still bright by the end of the evening, after several hours of wear. Maybe reapply after a few hours but I thought it still looked great! Excited to find one that will work so well for my wedding! I usually also don't like lipstick or lipgloss but this one was great. It didn't feel like I had anything on!"
