I've already gone though my Metropolitan palette and am thinking of buying the Impressionist because I love a natural look. <br /><br />The accent, glittery part is a tiny bit messy but is a nice touch to the eyes overall.<br /><br />Wonderful product for a great price!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","StellaBlue002","Charleston, WV",5,"I've never mastered the art of blending eyeshadow and my 'smoky eyes' always leave me looking like a racoon. This eyeshadow palette is for dummies like me. It's foolproof. The colors are gorgeous and I love the touch of shimmer. It's perfect for a casual or daytime look."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","Jillbles","Flemington, NJ",5,"I recently found out that I'm allergic to... um, everything. Seriously, if it's got lanolin, cocamidapropyl betaine, propylene glycol, methylisothiazolinone, or a number of other ingredients, I can't wear it. I lost hundreds of dollars in personal care products because most of them contained propylene glycol. Bare Minerals powders are, so far, safe. And so is this palette from Revlon, and their long-lasting lip stain/gloss.<br />I now have Pop Art and Renaissance palettes from this line. I love Pop Art; it's surprisingly versatile for a green palette. You don't HAVE to use the super sparkly glitter accent, if you don't want to, which is nice; I'm not exactly a party girl, and there's plenty of sparkle in the regular palette without going full-on SPARKLY. <br />Renaissance surprised me, as the main color is a much darker gray than I was expecting. Pretty, and it ended up working for my needs on that particular day, in the end. But be aware, this is less subtle gray, more CHECK ME OUT I'M GOTH. <br />There is a lot of fallout during application on both palettes, but once applied, it stayed on nicely. I didn't notice much in the way of creasing. The first times I used it, I went without primer (Urban Decay, which is what I had and loved, has propylene glycol); I did OK. For Renaissance, I had acquired a Bare Essentials eyelid primer without PG; worked out very nicely, but I probably could've gotten by without it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","care","LA",5,"I like the neutral colors, I don't apply it exactly as shown on the case, I like to the put the lighter shade on the top lid by my lashes to make a more youthful look with brighter eyes. I'm fair with freckles and red hair, but I think these colors will look good on almost everyone."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","Food Hussy","cincinnati OH",5,"I like this one - it has quite a few options for combinations. I also like that it came with two applicators - so you can have a separate side for each color. The glitter in it is a good balance too - it's not too young or over the top."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","kc41005","Northern Kentucky",2,"I own this in Impressionist and Metropolitan. I  purchased these when I was in the denial stage about how great the Naked palettes could possibly be so I purchased these instead, liking the shades offered. Here's my opinion- The shades that are meant to be primers are definitely lacking sufficient priming potential. They in no way compare to a liquid primer, so I took them for just another color in the palette and used my normal primer with them. Even with a good primer the color tends to fade fast. The glitter colors barely show up at all and they flake so bad it just turns your face into a hot mess, so that eliminated the want to use those. I do like the smoky greige in the Impressionist set, however as a whole this was the final straw that caused me to cave and buy the Naked 1 palette. Other shadows just don't compare in my opinion."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","loverUNDfighter","Lynnwood, WA",4,"I received this compact from Santa and can't stop playing with it. It is comprised of three purples and two sea-foam/green shades for accent. Although I have the #540 compact which is named &quot;muse&quot; and isn't pictured on the site you can google it and see what I'm raving about. I appreciate the numbered and color coded picture on the back for easy application and the shadows blend seamlessly. My only issue is the slight creasing in my lid but this is due to my lids and not the product."

The colors work amazingly well and you can go dramatic or natural.  Yes, it comes with sponge applicators, but I actually like to use them when packing on the brown and then use my own brushes for blending the rest.  I prefer this over my Naked palate and many other high-end brand eye shadows I own.  I am not a fan of the other colors but I am in love with Metropolitan and have probably purchased it over five times since it was released."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","Cindy Lou","Colorado Springs, CO",4,"The only thing that I did not like about this product is the cheap makeup applicators. They are not good for blending and they fall apart easily."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","LadyBorgia","NJ Beach",1,"I don't purchase Revlon often, but I saw this in 'Avant Garde' and ADORED the colors. A red flag should have gone off when I saw the sponge applicators from 1985 (even mini sample products come with a little brush or expect you to have a little purse sized set...or even one....I do as do most peoplr.) Anyway, the primer was ridiculous  (just light colored eyeshadow (depending on the look) that we all lay down after our actual concealer or eye primer) and I knew I was in trouble when I swatched it after opening  (HUGE problem of drugstore cosmetics! You can't swatch before buying so good stuff gets passed up unless you get a trusted source to vouch for it!) Pigments looked nothing like in the pans, except possibly the dark crease color, which was close, but muddier. I gave it a go anyway and the color payout is terrible and after packing a ridiculous amount of  the lid color on I *finally* got somewhat near the lid pan color, but patchy and blotchy no matter what I did (brush, finger...even terrible little sponges.) I'm skilled at make up application, but followed the directions as if a beginner (as this palette is set up for that.) Sorry Revlon, but this blends horribly, pigments are horrid and really is a rip off unless you just want to look at it in the package. Then it's very pretty. I thought maybe it might work as a facial highlighter.....mehhh nope! Save your money!!!!"

I have very sensitive skin and usually have to use more expensive brands. However I have always had luck with Revlon. The reason I purchased this compact was to keep in my car for last minute applications on my way home from work to go out with my fiance. I work outside so my morning application of makeup usually wipes off before I get home. We tend to go out to dinner last minute and I hope this works out! It blends really well to the point that the bright blue does not show like I thought it would. Hopefully this eye shadow holds up!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","Country Girl","West Chester, PA",3,"I did not expect it to be as dark as it was.  I purchased the 505 Impresionist, and the brown lid color is exaxtly that,brown, and did not look lighter if you tried to blend into the skin.  The complementary colors were OK, but were a severe contrast to the brown.  I would recommend only to medium or darker complections."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","JMo","Texas",3,"I usually use Urban Decay eyeshadows, but I was testing out a color so I purchased this Revlon mini palette as it was less expensive. It was a little tough to blend for me and the eyeshadow itself was very flaky and powdery not the quality I'm used to with the Urban Decay shadows, but it is wearable. I mean if your strapped for cash and want some fun colors I'd definitely recommend this mini palette."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4950063","Joey","New Jersey",2,"I have this in Impressionist.  Overall the palette leans towards okay, but is mostly meh.  The colors you can see are great, however, only two of the colors have any real color payoff.  The eye-shaped pan (a nice medium brown) and the one above it (a nice dark brown).  I bought this palette because of the included &quot;primer&quot; (the large rectangular shade).  However, was disappointed to find it did nothing for the other shadows, I have treated it like an extra shadow and find it to be minimally pigmented.  With real primer under these it took a while to build up any color from this particular shadow.  The lightest shade (top pan) took more time for still almost no color to show up.  The glitter (square pan) was the same, but created a huge mess.  The closeness of all the pans and craziness of the glitter made the palette itself a mess.  It is sad to say that my ELF and wet 'n wild palettes have a higher quality for less.<br /><br />Pros:<br />5 shadows<br />2 pigmented shadows<br /><br />Cons:<br />3/5 shadows are basically useless<br />Primer does nothing<br />Poor quality, especially for price"

I love the colors and it lasts all day... which not all products do even when they say they will.  I can wear it light for day or darken for at night (I add eyeliner).  I have used it almost every day."

I bought it to use for a special occasion but ended up just covering it up a bit. I love the palette though - so maybe with more time I would figure out the perfect amount to put on."
