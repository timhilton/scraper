I wish they'd go back to the dipped rubber on the holds b/c the gaskets on the thumb hole ultimately slip off (I've tried several brands). A minor inconvenience that will not dissuade me from buying again, however. I even bought one for a friend who claims if she were ever stranded on a desert island the only things she'd HAVE to have is lip balm and an eyelash curler ;-)"

The quality of the product is just not there. After about 3 days usage the top bar of the curler was loose.

I decided to buy this one because it stated &quot;extra curl&quot;. It does seem to give my eyelashes a bit of extra curl. I have used it BEFORE applying any mascara and after one coat. I saw a big difference when using after one coat of mascara and then applying 2 more coats. If you need a new curler, this is a good buy."

I've always only had to use one hand to curl my lashes, but I have to use both hands to make this curler work. I feel that its a bit hard to get it to close and curl my lashes effectively. Although i will say the product does curl my lashes, but it feels awkward to hold the curler and re-curl if needed."

I've been using this for several months and the refill has come very handy so don't loose it!<br /><br />If you're in middle or high school this is very affordable so you get a good eyelash curler for a good price."
