"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Naej","Mpls,MN",5,"Easy to apply and the color lasts longer than most lipstick."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Lip Smackin' Ash","Mobile, AL",4,"My only regret is not buying more colors! It's very smooth and the color truly does last. Most other &quot;color stay&quot; lipsticks I've used leave your lips feeling dry and painted on. This lipstick is very satiny feeling and leaves my lips feeling moisturized."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Kate the catlady","Allentown",2,"Was looking for a matte finish. I am in my sixties with some level of lip lines. I wanted to try a different finish to see is something minimized that. This just made my lips look dry. Better on younger women or maybe fuller lips."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Catlvr","North Carolina",2,"I like Revlon lipsticks and have been using them for years.   I am really disappointed in this one.  It does go on easily but the color payoff was not there.   It wears off easily and it tends to be sticky and roll up.   I won't buy again or recommend."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Nikki","Dfw, texas",4,"I would recommend this lipstick. It seems to last long. I just wish it was a tad darker."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Love me some Ulta","Souderton, PA",5,"From the first time I applied this lipstick, it instantly became my favorite. There are so many great color selections and it is so light, you hardly remember it is on!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","M","Texas",5,"I have tried many lipsticks in 50 something years.  This is the only one I buy again and again. It feels moist going on, sets in a few seconds then lasts for hours and hours.  I use a neutral pink like chapstick - except it lasts so much better - and looks great. Even application - get a color and love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Savannah Gal","Savannah, GA",5,"I have been buying this lipstick in two colors since Revlon introduced it. It has super lasting power and the color selection is great.I usually top it off with a gloss for added shine."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Kathy","Holiday, Florida",1,"I bought the lipstick, because the color looked nice, but when I put it on, there was barely any color at all. I'll be returning it the next time that I come back to the store."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Nursemarsh","East peoria IL",5,"Stays on better than any other lipstick that I have used in the past. Many color selections and goes on smoothly. So far very satisfied with this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Lynn","Grenada",5,"I put this lipstick on in the morning.  I don't need to reapply till after i eat at lunch.  Really, even after eating, it is still on.  It just needs reapplying after I have wiped my lips.  I have never had a lipstick to hold on for as long as this does.  It doesn't dry my lips like some &quot;long-lasting&quot; color does!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Sana","MO",1,"I love the colors available. I was looking for a nice bright pink, and this fit the bill. It applies easily. But it is very drying. The 'matte' finish seems like it just sucks the moisture out of my lips. My lips became so dry that all the fine lines were amplified in my lips. I've tried to apply a lip moisturizer before or after application, but it hasn't helped. It makes my lips &quot;pill.&quot; The color doesn't last long either (maybe an hour or so, won't make it through a dinner). I bought this in two shades, and will return the second one, which I haven't opened yet. I'm really disappointed, probably the worst experience I've had with a lipstick :( At least it was inexpensive."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Michelle","Philadelphia",5,"I tried this and was initially put off because it felt a bit sticky, but after a couple of hours, it wasn't sticky anymore, but it really stayed put!  It even stayed on through a shower!   I was trying to match a Revlon sheer color and this is the perfect match, with better coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Nessie","Kingsport Tennessee",4,"All products that I buy it is so great I love it because the lipsticks one use its gonna all day u don't wanna put lipstick all the time even u wanna after u eat the lipstick still there."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Carissa","Canton, OH",1,"This lipstick personally did not work well for me at all. I usually exfoliate and moisturize my lips the night before, however that didn't seem to help with this product. It lasted for about 20 minutes and I had to keep applying and applying. It was very uncomfortable and sticky right after I put it on. Then after an hour or so I'd get streaky lines and it would look very uneven."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Oldmomma","Oregon",5,"I have about every brand of Lip color.  Mac and Est&eacute;e Lauder are my faves but I decided to try this for its lasting color.  5 stars!!  I can't wear lipstick or makeup with a scent. This has none whatsoever.   I will purchase again."

Not too drying though but there are better options"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","WhotheDoctor","Plantation,FL",4,"Since this stuff dries on quick for me i use a bit of lip balm on top. I love the packaging, it doesn't look tacky."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Dana","Birmingham, AL",4,"Colorstay does actually stay on for at least 8-12 hours, even while eating or drinking. The original gloss/shimmer that you get when first applied does not stay for long, but it tints your lips enough to have that natural look and not have to worry if your lips look bare.  It does not dry out your lips AT ALL, but it feels a bit sticky or tacky when applied. If they had a solution this, it would be my go-to lipstick for eternity!"

I absolutely adore the colors themselves, but soon after putting them on it just leaves my lips feeling sticky.  I will not purchase again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Cookie010","Laredo, Texas",2,"Nice color, it has a bit of glitter though. It makes it look trashy once the color starts to wear off. It's not moisturizing either."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Cat on a hot tin roof","San Angelo, TX",2,"I bought this in Finale. It has great color payoff, but the consistency of the product went on sticky. It did not glide on to the lips like &quot;Ultimate Suede&quot; as the name suggests. It stayed sticky on the lips and formed a ring around the inside of the lip as it wore off. Couldn't wait to wipe it off!!!!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Honest &amp; true","Monroe Twp, NJ",4,"I use this every day. My only con is that it doesn't take many uses before the container it's in separates.  A royal pain to keep it in 2 pcs instead of 3. The bottom half separates into 2 pieces."

I do wish it felt a little more moisturizing throughout the day but I remedy that by applying chapstick if needed."

I'm always on the lookout for the perfect shade of plum lipstick.  Like previous ColorStays I've tried, this product goes on a bit thin and lasts longer than your average cream lipstick (though certainly not as long as Outlast or similar).  The other reviews mention &quot;stickiness&quot; with this product and I'd have to agree.  I've been layering L'Oreal Colour Riche Balm over it and that seems to help the sticky feeling without impacting the color.  The only disappointment for me is that Backstage isn't really plum on me, it's more of a red with plum undertones.  So I'm still looking for my perfect shade of plum!"

When I put it on this morning, I liked it and felt like it might have some staying power.  It lasted a bit longer than normal, but many hours later, it feels gooey and sticky.  Going in the trash."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Laurenkelly","South Jersery",5,"I love this lipstick. My mom  had bought it for herself, and she didn't like the color, so she gave it to me. I love how long it lasts. This my go-to lipstick. I found that if I put it on, and wait 10-15 mins before drinking or eating anything, it stays on all night long. Sometimes I reapply once throughout thr night, but the next morning I have to take it off, with make-up remover wipes."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Gazelle","Texas",5,"I use this product once and it lasts through the entire day, maybe have to reapply once.<br /><br />The only con is it tends to feel a bit dry after a while, so I usually add a little balm after application."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Kris","Michigan",3,"I got the shade high heels and it was pretty much the shade on the outside so that was a good quality. However, these are very drying. Not very long lasting either. I like the container. You have to turn and 'click' the product up and its pretty neat. The formula really does feel like suede, until it wears away and you're left with clumpy dry lips. I wont repurchase. If you have very hydrated lips though, go for it. It'd be a great product without that issue."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","rojas","el paso, tx",1,"The color is great however, it dry's and your lips look cracked.  Not worth the price."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Annamarie RN","Montgomery AL",5,"I hate to re-apply lip color. I hate dry lips from long lasting color. This was wonderful. It went on soft, stayed soft and stayed on. It was a natural color but when I went to remove my make-up the proof was on the cloth! I will buy more!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","xocnt","Cherryville, NC",1,"I am pretty disappointed with this product. I love the more matte lipsticks and with the title &quot;suede&quot; i was pulled in! It goes on super clumpy. If your lips aren't perfect and have lines or are chapped even in the slightest, this stuff settles in those lines and gets caught up in the chapped areas. Most lipsticks are forgiving but this one just accentuated the lines in my lips and made them look ten times more chapped than they were. Definitely would not rebuy."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","mkpfunky","PA",4,"Ulta has the best selection of colors and I like this product for color over lip balm.  I top it with a little gloss and go.  I don't like a bold lip on me, but this can go bold, depending on the shade you pick and whether you apply to dry lips or over balm.  Nice product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Steph","Pensacola, FL",1,"I don't generally write poor reviews, but very difficult to find anything good to write about this lipstick.  I am inclined to return it.  It's hard to tell if it is a defective or old tube or just truly how it wears."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Javajabbers","Medford, OR",4,"I was really not expecting much with this because most &quot;colorstay&quot; products I've tried haven't really lived up to the hype. This one definitely does.  Although I listed that it is drying, it is only slightly so.  It goes on as a gloss and then dries.  It's not tacky and clumpy like long lasting colors of the past, but it has a very slight tack that is easily covered by lip balm. It doesn't flake either."

I don't wear a lot of lipstick, but wanted to get a natural looking one.  I was impressed with this line.  It does stay on a long time, even through eating and drinking.  And the beauty of it is that it didn't dry my lips out like many lipsticks do, which is why I don't wear it often.  This one feels very moisturizing.  I would definitely buy this in more colors if I want more lipstick."

I bought this lipstick because they had the perfect colour!! <br />It went on smooth and the colour was perfect in one application. It became a little sticky and then dry feeling but then all of a sudden i couldnt feel it. I thought for sure it washes off because i had licked my lips so i went to check and sure enough it was still there. It lasted all night( adult beverages were involved) and this morning when i woke up you could still see the colour!!"

Its beautiful - I bought one tube about 2 weeks ago, and have gone back and bought 2 more since.  Supermodel and Runway are my favorites!  I love the finish - not too shiny (but not really matte until a bit later when its worn a little bit).  And my favorite quality about this lipstick is that it stays on through most of my morning and if I forget to reapply, my lips still carry a pretty stain of the color."

For me it made my lips feel like chaped super dry and like maybe an hour later the color isnt as pigminted as when you first apply it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","MaydlC","Cliffwood Beach, NJ",5,"This lipstick is absolutely wonderful!  It really does last as long as it claims, even longer!  I ate, drank, brushed my teeth, even slept with it on and it still looked like I had just applied it.  It doesn't make my lips dry like other long-lasting lipsticks.  It does feel slightly sticky, but it's the slightest sticky feeling.      <br /><br />I would wait a while before eating, drinking, etc. so that it can dry.  Also make sure that your lips are clean before applying.  This way you'll get the full long-lasting effects."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Beauty Fiend","Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,"I wasn't much of a &quot;lipstick all the time&quot; person. Lipstick can be high-maintenance, plus I have pale lips and like it, especially for my everyday look- which I prefer to be more natural. However I adore the subtle shades this new lipstick line offers, and absolutely love how easy, no-maintenance it is. It stays on virtually forever and never(I mean NEVER) smears.<br />However, it is dry. Not when you first apply it but shortly afterward. And it's more of a matte than a glossy finish, which personally I don't mind at all. Besides, I've found that a thin layer of clear chapstick or gloss will combat the dryness issue and add some shine.<br />So bottom line- I'd recommend this to a friend, depending on what they're looking for. If you want a bold, moisturizing, glossy-finish lipstick then no, this isn't for you. But if you don't mind either the dry/matte aspect or adding some gloss over top, and you want a long-lasting, doesn't budge, &quot;you mean I can wear lipstick without checking the mirror every 20 minutes to be sure it's still there and on the right part of my face&quot; lipstick then yes, you'll want this.<br /><br />Personally, it's made a &quot;lipstick-everyday&quot; girl out of me!"

Upon application this applied very smoothly &amp; evenly . For me it wasn't drying at all (but I do live in lip balm when not in lipstick) I went about my day again not expecting anything , BUT then through eating spaghetti &amp; drinking ,brushing my teeth AND falling asleep, then eating &amp; drinking again .....this is still on as if it were freshly applied !!!!! I am so happy I stumbled across this . The price for the quality is really good as well compared to what I have paid with other lipsticks that do not hold up even half as good.

I am a red lip wearer every day for work and I can apply it in the morning and it last about 6-8 hours a day, with a minor matte gloss touch up.  It easily removes at the end of the day with petroleum jelly and wiped off.  I snack all day at work on fruit and salads and it lasts through apple eating.   The price point is a great value considering how long it lasts all day.  The color doesn't dry out either.  If I make a mistake in application I use a dry Qtip and clean up the lines immediately before the color sets.   It isn't a gloss finish and more of a matte set."

My ideal shade gives me a natural color yet doesn't look tacky and this is it. I got 'finale' because I like the cherry red undertone. It's much lighter and sheerer than it appears but that's what I prefer for a natural look. I exfoliated and put on lip balm before application. It did apply unevenly but I evened it out with my finger. I'm so glad it met my biggest desires; actually lasts after lots of use and gives a natural, flattering color! I'm glad I tried it even with the negative reviews."

I think it's best to make sure your lips have been properly conditioned before application of this lipstick to prevent over-drying. <br /><br />I liked the color and wear for shade 085 trendsetter, it's a good bright red with no unnecessary sparkles. I wouldln't wear it every day, but for a special dinner I think it would be appropriate."

This is my new favorite product and it is not necessary to spend any more money on lipsticks that make the same claims. I will certainly be buying more in the very near future.

It seems like less colors and formula is a little drying. When applied it feels nice and smooth and color goes on lighter than whats in the tube, but is very buildable. After a couple minutes the color 'drys' and 'stains' your lips for the lasting color. It leaves my lips feeling dry, nothing a lip balm or lip gloss can fix but thats a con for me."

However, the colors are not true to their samples at all. I bought a deep blue-tinted red that I thought would go perfectly with the navy blue sweater I was wearing. I put it on while walking to the next store with some friends, didn't think anything of it. I happened to pass a mirror and realized that I had a fluorescent pink on my lips, it looked ridiculous. Having said that, it's pretty impossible to get off without some makeup remover, so I believe that it would last a good 8-10 hours. I'm bummed about the color, which is the most important part to me, so this gets an overall thumbs down."

It's a good, long lasting color if used right. It will last for hours though once it dries it does feel a bit dry &amp; it will wear off if you eat greasy food. One note though, it layers really well...so if you're trying to touch up it may look heavier on the parts of your lip that already had good coverage."

After trying this product, I will have to continue looking. I was optimistic at first, it goes on smooth with great color and coverage. However, it quickly dries out and gets flaky/clumpy.

I was really excited about the the lipsticks when I first got it. I loved the colors  - I got Backstage and Private Showing, I think - and when I first put them on they seemed great - they felt soft and moisturizing right after application and they looked really nice and even on my lips. Buuuuut, probably less than an hour later, the lipstick dried my lips out - like, a lot. And it started clumping and looking really weird on my lips. I've figured out a way that gets the lipstick to look fine, but it involves using like three products - a chapstick, a lip cream, and the product itself. When I buy a lipstick I really just want to use the lipstick and not a whole heap of product just to make the one lipstick look decent. Clearly, I did not like this product."

It doesn't come with a moisturizing top coat but it isn't really drying at least so it's bearable. I notice it stays on through my morning coffee, not rubbed off on the cup. The color is a little deceiving though. I bought this one looking for a brown. I didn't realize until I got home that I already have this color- it's very neutral beige."

None of them deliver on their promises, and this one was no exception. I let it dry for several minutes, as suggested, but then it started to immediately wear off on my drink straw, and was completely gone after lunch. I tried applying again, with lip balm underneath, and that made it worse... it basically slid right off. The color selection is also pretty bad if you're a cool/fair skin tone. There were only two I saw that seemed cool toned, &quot;Muse&quot; and &quot;Silhouette&quot; -- I purchased Silhouette and while the color itself was okay, it had a horrible 80's throwback frosty finish."

I've worn it to dinners and the first time I raced to the bathroom after eating to reapply and there was no need, it will looked perfect. It does stain around your mouth a bit when you remove it so use a good make up remover because like any good long lasting lipstick it can be difficult to remove. My only complaint is there aren't more colors. I have the dark purples, red, and a couple links but there aren't any light links that don't remind me of bubble gum. I can get passed that though.

People often think I'm wearing lipstick, when all I have on is clear lip balm.  That said, you can hardly see this color on my lips, despite it being a pretty vivid coral pink in the tube.  The formula isn't drying, but I also didn't think it stayed on longer than an hour or two.  The best part about it is the container.  Two solid clicks keeps it well closed.  I wanted to love this, but I don't even like it."

I saw this in store, and bought it on a whim. I fell in love the minute I put it on. Just the color I had been looking for! It was a little sticky until it dried but then it felt great! It stayed put well. It does feel a little dry, but I actually like it in this perticular product. I just wish they had a better color selection!"

This lipstick goes on smooth but leaves a sticky feel. The other kind I was looking for goes on smooth and it never feels like you have anything on your lips but it stays until you wipe it off."

I also believe the price is fair."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Garnet074","Chicago, IL",5,"I've been hunting for a lip product that actually stays put, more of a lip stain type look.  With the market flooded by lipsticks, lip tints, tinted balms, lip gloss, etc., it's next to impossible to find something that truly stays when it says it's going to stay, so I've tried tons of products from tubes to tins to &quot;chubby&quot; pencils.  This week I tried Revlon's Color Stay Ultimate Suede lipstick and I gotta say... it stays!<br /><br />The color selection on the line seems to trend toward 3 tones: Pink, Red, Brown.  I'm not overly blown away by the selection, but there is enough there that someone should be able to find something that works for them.<br /><br />I applied it soon as I got out of the store.  Goes on smooth, seemed surprisingly shiny, went on moist.  After that I left it alone.  No rubbing of my lips together, no blotting, nothing as I drove to my next location.  I noticed a stickiness to my lips, but I didn't think it was that bad compared to some of the products I've tried.  Some of those are like glue where you have to peel your lips apart.  This is NOT one of those products and if you let it dry until that stickiness is all but gone, I think you get a much superior result than if you don't wait.  <br /><br />I forgot all about my lips through lunch. I ate, drank, talked, wiped my mouth with napkins, etc., with nary a notice of color transfer (YES!).  When I got back into my car and glanced in the rear view mirror?  The color was still there!  Not &quot;just kinda&quot; still there &quot;maybe I need to re-apply&quot; but still there pow! noticeable color!<br /><br />Gone was the shiny finish, moisture feel, and stickiness, and left behind was a matte color stain.  Were my lips dry? Yes. Did they feel &quot;dry&quot; as in &quot;ew my lips I dry I need a balm&quot;?  No.  And that stain stayed and stayed and stayed until much later in the evening.<br /><br />So I think the keys to successful application are to apply and leave it alone!  Let it dry.  Watch for that glossy sheen to fade off and the matte look to appear.  This can take a little while.  I'd also caution against applying a clear gloss or balm on top of the this product because I think that definitely shortens the staying power and &quot;lifts&quot; the color.  I think these are tricks to help the staying power and I've pretty much learned you can't really have &quot;shiny&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; and stain.  That's jmho.<br /><br />I gave this the night test too.  I applied it in the evening, slept all night in it (I know, I know, not something you're supposed to do but I was curious) and when I got up?  Not a trace of color on the pillow case or my face but it was still on my lips.<br /><br />I'm impressed with this product enough to be shopping for more colors on the best sale."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Angela","New Richmond, WI",3,"This lipstick is okay. There is nothing really bad about it, but nothing great to brag about.  It doesn't last very long, and isn't very creamy or moisterizing.  I won't buy again, but I will use the rest of it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","orangecrush","sunny FL",3,"I really wanted to try the new light pink lip trend because I think it is so flattering for someone over 40 like me. Problem is, lipstick does not stay on me. Unfortunately, this was no exception. I loved the color on application, but even with primer it just wouldn't stay put more than an hour and a half. I am not willing to fuss with anything that much, so this is a loss for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Tristan's Lady","McLean, Virginia",1,"First of all, the container is cheap looking and clicks when you wind it.

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-suede-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod4950065","Helen S.","Las Vegas, NV",4,"True to it's claim, it does stay on a long time.  Even after drinking coffee.  I feel that this is a great product for everday use during the daytime.  <br />The only negative is that I think of this as a lipstain not a lipstick.  The color stays but the creamyness is gone.  Great for busy moms and students in college!"

I naturally have ruby red lips (more of a curse than it sounds) and it's difficult to get any colors to show. I normally use clear lip gloss but decided to give this a try. I got the color &quot;It Girl&quot; and LOVE IT. The color actually covers my natural color and lasts pretty much all day. It doesn't smear or smudge or make my lips look dry or cakey. I also get alot of compliments when wearing it. I am definitely going to purchase more colors!"
