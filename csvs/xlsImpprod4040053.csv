"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","TOLeary","Memphis, TN",5,"The best primer to wear under make-up if you have oily skin. Doesn't break-out sensitive skin, and looks very natural."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Jers","Pasadena, CA",5,"I use it with &amp; without foundation. It's a great product to smooth the skin!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","foxy-great-gram","White Lake,NY",5,"Use it under liquid foundation. Does a great job minimizing most flaws on my face. Save the job of adding other products to do that.<br />Have not found any other product to compare with this. Have fair, sensitive skin. No redness or sensitivity... Also no fragrance as I must have."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","KR","Grand Rapids, Michigan",4,"I am 64 years old and I can use this product without foundation. It smooths my skin, covers pores, and helps even out my skin color."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Blondiex1476","Highland, IN",4,"This primer is amazing I have very sensitive skin so many products make me breakout.  Very smooth consistency and is not thick on skin. Only con is once product gets low it's difficult to get it out."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","VioletFire","WA",2,"It's just not that great.  It's a primer, it didn't make me break out and it didn't alter the color or texture of my makeup - that is pretty much the extent of its virtue.  It didn't make my makeup stay any longer than usual.  I have large pores, so I wasn't expecting miracles, but I noticed no difference with this primer.  I have combo skin, so try to keep things on the matte side, but I was shiny in a couple hours after applying.  Really nothing special."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Lakyn","Shreveport, La",5,"This works better than Smashbox primer! Never have I gotten so many compliments on how great and matte my makeup looks! Love love loveeee!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","TLayne","Houston, TX",4,"I'm 63 years old and have deep wrinkles, large pores,  sensitive, combination skin.  I've tried almost every primer available and some were very expensive.  Nothing is going to take my wrinkles and pores away; was just looking for something to minimize and smooth.  This was the product for me.  Although I don't wear makeup daily, I do use this on a daily basis. I rarely post anything about a product, but this was worth the time."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Lori","Festus, MO",4,"A little goes a long way!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Urban decay girl","orlando, fl",5,"This is my new favorite primer!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Kat","Madison, WI",2,"I read a lot of good reviews on this stuff so I thought I would give it a try. I use it under my tarte amazonian clay liquid foundation. I bought both at the same time and I thought I was unhappy with the tarte, but after cutting out this primer I realize that it was the problem. Made my foundation not cover well and almost made it seem too thick. The only pro to this product was that it made my foundation stay all day, however it didn't look the greatest. Definitely going to look for a better primer."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","BeautyKat","New York, New York",3,"This primer was easy to apply and goes on pretty smooth. I have oily skin and overall it does a good job on mattifying my skin. However, I do need to touch up with powder towards the end of the day and much sooner on more humid/hotter summer days. My biggest problem with this primer is that it makes blending concealer on areas around my nose and lips more difficult. The look is not is not as seamless and the concealer tends to build up around those dry areas."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","lesleyal","Las Vegas Nv",1,"I bought this primer because I read A review of an Ulta employee that said it was comparable to the Smashbox primer. Biggest lie ever! This product is so water based and it smells so bad. To top it off it sucks at being a primer. Dont waste your money on this"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","lesleyal","Las Vegas",1,"I bought this product because I read that it was comparable to the Smashbox Primer that I use. Lies!It so liquidy and it felt like i was putting water on my face. Im returning it ASAP.This product was gross."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Grannylady","Heartland",4,"Doesn't feel heavy or goopy, used it with powders and cream/liquid based foundations."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Umma","Northwest Arkansas",3,"It does help makeup last all day, but it dries quickly and makes application of liquid foundation a little tricky since it doesn't glide smoothly over the primer.  But I would still recommend it because of how well the makeup stays."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Tilly","Cape May, New Jersey",3,"I used under my foundation and it made my face to white and chalky. Even under my foundation.. For fair skinned people"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","catie96","cincinnati ohio",5,"I love how smooth it makes my face feel, It truly holds to what it says it does, my favorite primer!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","TM","richmond, va",3,"When i bought this i thought it would be nice to use under my cover up.  I used it for a couple of days and it was ok, i didnt see much of a difference and then after the couple days i put it on and noticed when i let it sit without putting make up on i had white clumps on my face, almost like i wiped my face with toilet paper."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Swirlz","CA",5,"I was desperately looking for this and finally found it and Im in love with it. I love the pump. It makes my skin feel so smooth, much better then my LG Spackle. It makes my makeup last all day"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Lisa","Allentown ,pa",5,"Use underneath makeup even in light looks beautiful..."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Miss Vicki","Indiana",2,"I was looking for a less-expensive alternative to my usual primer so I gave this a go. However, I found this too lightweight and it seemed more like a face lotion than a primer. My face also felt more oily than ususal midday. I ended up returning it and going back to my normal brand."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","SunnySideMuah","Humble,TX",1,"this is product is not even close to a PRIMER!!<br />more like a sticky glue stuff on ur face.<br />I hate it!!!<br />Taking it back"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","BREE","NJ",3,"i tried this product along with SEVERAL different foundations on a quest for the perfect combination.  I found with foundation it tended to make the foundation slide on the oily areas of my face.  That being said if you wear this out with powder (or just as is) it works really well in making your skin look more matte and smooth."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Annabelle","Rowell, GA",3,"This has good coverage on little imperfections as well as hiding pores. However, it lacks glow, because it has a very dull appearance, maybe a overly powdered look. I will use it again, but only for everyday at home, and not for special occasions. Will refer it to friends, but with info on my personal experience with it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Brooke","Plymouth",2,"This product broke me out, BUT I have very sensitive skin. Application and final look, I liked as much or better than Smashbox's primer. No pores all day!! Less shiny for much longer! (I only powder my face after using this.) It only comes in one color, but it did not seem to leave any white (I am pretty fair though, but I do try to look for that!!). <br />If you don't tend to break out from products, GET THIS, I'm so mad it broke me out!! If you do break out sometimes, I mean, this wasn't a huge breakout, I've had much worse, so I guess if you're daring?"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Dale","Macon,GA",5,"This is my first and only primer. Ive never used anything but this. I really like it. It makes my face feel like silk and keeps my make-up on all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Stacy","Petoskey, MI",3,"I picked this product up in a drugstore since I was out of my go-to primer and while it is fine if you will only be wearing foundation for a few hours for going out at night, it does not last much longer than that, it tends to smear even a very light foundation application. It has the consistency of a serum/light lotion, and I prefer a primer with more of a clay consistency. I will finish the product, though will not buy again."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Munchkin011","Phoenix, az",4,"I have insanely dry/oily skin and all I have to do is exfoliate, add a moisturizer to my skin, and throw this on! It stays on whether I am sweating, or not, looks great all day! Keeps oiliness way down and I can wear it with or without makeup!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Namana","Florida",2,"I have recently been really into primers, and have been trying so many that I am quickly becoming a hoarder.<br />This was a disappointment though. It is rather thick and pasty, and can cake up in some areas when you apply foundation on top. I wish it was a little thinner. <br />I will wear this day-to-day, but for the price and for the fact that this is a Revlon product, I'm pretty disappointed. Just glad I picked it up on sale."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Nitro Harley","Albuquerque, NM",3,"Works good for everydayv use."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Brit","Beavercreek, OH",1,"Do not buy, doesn't help."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","LadyInRed","Oak Creek, WI",4,"This primer is really good, ESPECIALLY if your looking for an inexpensive backup for Smashbox primer. Helps foundation last all day, is grease-less and light. I chose the one without color. If you have big pores, this might not give you the coverage you want - but it all depends on what you want from a primer."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Kate","Chicago",1,"If you are only planning on using this product to reduce shine and matte the skin, it will work just fine. Once you start trying to put anything on top of it, however, you will begin to have issues. I have owned 5 different primers so far (Smashbox and pores no more are my favorites) and this one was the worst once I tried to put makeup on. It will prevent the makeup from blending in to the skin, and it is supposed to help makeup blend in. It did very little to extend staying power. I can only really use it if I don't actually want to use makeup and I just want my skin to be more matte."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","EverlyAnn","Los Angeles",1,"I tried to like this but I couldnt, i have t zone skine and this product left my skin oily really soon after applying, i didnt apply a lot either. Maybe is the weather that melts the product, who knows but i will not repurchase again."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Lindsey","New Jersey",3,"The overall primer was okay and worked but if just used alone it tended to flake off a bit."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Vanna","Cali",5,"This primer is better then Philosophy &amp; I'd just like the NARS primer, I LOVE it. I put it on half of the top of my head and showed my bf, he was amazed at what it did. It's instantly mattifies the skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","millipea","Austin, TX",5,"I was skeptical of all primers, but I settled on trying a budget friendly option before tackling any expensive brands.<br /><br />First, Let me divulge what kind of skin I am wearing. I am very oily in the T-zone area and usually drier on the rest of my face. My skin ranges from fair to medium and is yellow based. I work in an office setting with stagnant/poor air quality which gets the oil on my face producing faster and my makeup just fades away. I break out from stress and makeup just makes it worse. <br /><br />This primer has canged my routine! After rinshing and drying my face in the morning I smooth a very small amount over my face (not even a full pump), eye lids and neck. A small amount goes a long way! The primer creates a smooth layer over your skin much like an invisible film for smoother application of makeup products. The primer makes cover ups for blemishes and acne easier too as the makeup settles on the primer and doesn't get absorbed into the acne.<br /><br />I still do get a little oily, but that is normal because you still have the same skin you were born with. But the oiliness is more even and instead looks like a light dew. I definitely don't mind this! If I were to go out in the evening though I would definitely rewash my face and reapply the primer and my makeup.<br /><br />Less definitely is more with this primer!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Amy","Tallahassee, FL",4,"No matter what foundation I use this underneath it keeps my face looking fresh. It's really lightweight and makes my face super soft. I love it!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Just wants my  makeup to last","Jackson MS",2,"While this had helped moisturize my dry skin, I don't see it making my makeup last longer at all.  I am not sure about whether it helps your skin look better or not in pictures.  I would NOT use this if your skin is oily or &quot;normal&quot; as it would probably cause breakouts.  But like I said, it has helped moisturize my dry skin"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","pEI","Canton,MI",3,"This product does help foundation to stay fresh looking longer.  It doesn't &quot;slide&quot; on like other primers I have used."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Trevor","Pittsburgh, PA",5,"It's a very nice primer, it's a little bit sticky when you first apply it, (but that's a good thing because it gives you're foundation something too really cling to so it can last all day.) I have normal skin, so I can't really say how it works on dry/oily types, but it worked for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","KaylaAnn","Oklahoma",1,"I purchased this after I ran out of another primer because I'd heard good things, but I simply wasn't impressed. It highlighted imperfections as well as made my skin look dry and flaky. The coverage was very thick and my foundation seemed to just sit on top. It might be just my preference for natural looking make-up and the &quot;no make-up&quot; look, but I felt like my face looked cake-y. Wish it worked better!"

BUT it does make my liquid makeup go on smoothly and last ALL day long from 6am to 9pm.  and it looks GREAT the whole time."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Hannah","Cincinnati, OH",5,"I really like this primer. it goes on really well, and stays put under makeup. it doesnt really have much of a smell, and it keeps me from getting greasy. also it does not break me out, and it makes my makeup stay on alot longer, and look a WHOLE LOT better. it also makes makeup go on alot smoother, and it makes my pores look smaller."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Aberantt","Baton Rouge La.",5,"This is hands down the BEST primer I have ever used! I never could understand the big fuss about primer because I never could tell the difference when I had one on verses when I didn't UNTIL I tried this! This stuff is golden! As soon as I put it on my skin looked noticeably smoother. Worth every penny!"

Took a shot in the dark and grabbed it at the grocery store the other day and I love it. great application and smoothness and helps my make-up look smooth and stay on while my skin looks smoother"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Emily","Fort Worth, TX",4,"For the money, this primer cannot be beat. I think, as a primer its comparable to SmashBox or Laura Mercier. I do notice it leaves a *very* matte finish if worn alone...but I never do that. I really love it under Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer or the new Benefit Oxygen Wow foundation. Really helps both lightweight options last, yet doesn't defeat the pleasure of their weight."

I found that it was very easy to apply.. After applying my moisturizer, I use my hands to apply it onto my face the same way I do my moisturizer.. It feels very soft and light &amp; my makeup applies smoothly over it. I wouldn't recommend using it alone, especially not for medium skin tones like mine because it looks a little light &amp; chalky alone, but it's great for under makeup.  The only problem I have is that my eyeliner &amp; eyeshadow tend to smear more.."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Kat","Phoenix, AZ",3,"I used this primer for 6 days and thought it was awesome.  By the end of the 6th day, I had developed a rash, not pimples, but little red bumps all over my face.  I have pretty sensitive skin, so I'm disappointed, but not entirely surprised.  The primer really smoothed the appearance of pores and reduced oily shine.  I also use the Photo Ready foundation and they work great together.  I have no rash problem with the foundation."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","J","Savannah",2,"Bought this because I wanted to start using primers with my makeup and this was the first one I found. I've used it a few times with bb creams and foundations and it didn't make much of a difference. When I used it under my Revlon color stay for oily skin it actually made it look worse. Does smell like glue but it goes away once applied. It did feel nice and smooth on my skin and made it softer but as far as a difference in my makeup lasting, it did nothing."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Peacelilly","Melbourne, FL",4,"I use this product over my moisturizer and under my foundation.  It makes my skin look very smooth, it stays on until I take it off and makes my foundation look good all day.  The price is reasonable so I have no complaints about this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Reyna","Mission Viejo, Ca",5,"I use this product everyday and in fact, can't be without it. This primer is like starting with a clean smooth canvas before the art of make up. So light you wouldn't know it's there except that you can definitely see the difference. Makes my face look younger, fresher. Makeup adheres and lasts longer, and I find I need less makeup because of it. My only complaint is the pump bottle. I like the convenience of the pump. But, it would be better if the pump screwed off, otherwise the last third of the primer is impossible to get out. Great product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Gina","tucson az",5,"I have used this product for years and love the results.  It keeps the shine off for hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","devlebaba","Georgia",2,"I feel like I should love this but I don't. It feels so heavy under foundation, I've tried it many ways.. I've tried applying and letting it set for 10+ minutes or more and I've tried it by applying foundation directly afterwards.  I feel like it makes my non oily skin oily. I also don't feel like my foundation sticks to it and by the end of an 8 hour day I feel like I have lost most of my face because product comes off easily. I wouldn't even say I have large pores or anything to really want to blur. I don't suggest this to anyone with normal to dry skin like mine.

Goes down super smoothly after moisturizer and immediately mattifies.  It is a bit thick but I don't feel it after i put foundation on.  Foundation also applies smoothly.  I don't think it has a pore-filling property but it does seem to blur pretty well.  After a 10 hour day my skin does still get oily and my nose after about half a day but that is impressive for my level of oily skin and I don't use a mattifying/setting powder on top of my foundation."

EVER.<br />Smooth and easy to apply, Revlon's Photoready primer is my official queen of my beauty stash. When used in moderation (a little bit goes a long way!), it will not clog pores, cause breakouts, over dry, or cake up. However, because of it's mattifying effects, I highly recommend using a moisturizer first for those with sensitive or dry skin.<br />Worn below my foundation and powder, it provides me incredible wear for up to 18 hours, even in humid temperatures! It's incredible coverage fills in lines, wrinkles, pores, and more!<br />TIPS:<br />1. This shine-control formula can be drying to sensitive skin! Use a moisturizer first if you need!<br />2. A little goes a long way! Be sure to apply foundation immediately after to ensure optimum smoothness! Too much and you'll clump or clog your pores.<br />3. YES! It does work for eyelids! Just don't get it in your eyes!!!<br />4. Pop off the black lid with a screwdriver or spoon when the pump can no longer reach the remaining product. With a brush end or stick, you can scoop up the remaining with ease! Don't forget to put the cap on between uses to keep it from drying out!"

I work in front of a computer all day, right next to the front door of the building, so although I'm not getting sunshine I'm getting a constant draft from the people who walk in and out. <br /><br />I hate to give this product two stars, as Revlon is one of the two drug store brands that actually works for me, but it did absolutely nothing for the makeup. For a few weeks I used it with Revlon Photoready foundation (liquid to powder) and the foundation not only didn't stay on for long, but my skin would get very oily. I tried it with another foundation (I forgot which one), and while my skin didn't get oily, the foundation wore off as though I wasn't using a primer.<br /><br />This primer is intended for photographs, but I haven't had my picture taken while wearing it, so I added one star because I don't know how useful it is concerning portrait photography.<br />I would not recommend this product for daily use."

I also don't like wearing any kind of full-coverage makeup so this is the perfect inbetween. <br /><br />BUT don't wear too much, more than 1 pumps worth and it gets flaky and paper-y.

I have oily brown skin( I am from Brazil) and one thing I was always very disappointed about makeup is that it would ALWAYS melt on my eye lids withing less than 1 hour. I started using waterproof eye liner to try to have it last a little longer with not much success. So I decided to try a primer and I just didn't want to pay a lot for it and purchased the REVLON at a drugstore. WHAT A SUCCESS!!!! BINGO! My make up lasts over 12 hours a day. I am not kidding.I am not doing anything different except for using this primer on my face. After 12 hours my entire face looks just as good as when I first applied the makeup. I use the cheapest makeup form drugstores I can find and it will still be amazing after all day wearing it. I even use regular eyeliner and it will be just perfect! This product is very very light when you apply and makes my skin feel like silk. Just awesome!Thank you REVLON"

This stuff works very well for normal to combo skin. If you have dry skin or even oily skin you might not like this. <br /><br />The smell is ever so slightly off putting, but you can't detect it once it's on your face. The pump makes this so convenient and easy to use. I recommend rubbing together with your fingers and then patting this on your face, rather than SMEARING it on. The finish is much more natural. I will continue to repurchase this."

These two products together give me an awesome flawless look that last from morning to night. I look fabulous all day long!  Isn't that what every women wants that loves makeup?"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Mm","Springfield",5,"This is by far my favorite primer.it makes my makeup last all day,it smooths out my face and unlike other primers it doesn't my skin oily after a couple hours of wear. But this does have some cons.  It does cause me to break out,not bad but more than I usually do. Second, it's not silicone based and reminds me of a paste and does feel a little heavy on the skin. After using this for a few days I have switch to a different primer because for some reason I can't understand it stops working effectively, after a couple of days I switch back to the revlon and I works beautifully. I' m puzzled why this happens. <br />But despite the cons it's still the primer I grab for and I will continue to use this. The cons are not bad enough for me to quit using it, it's just a little annoying."

I was tired of shelling out lots of money for higher end primers so I decided to give this one a try. A big plus was the fact that it gives you a lot of product for less. It is velvety smooth, it dries to a matte finish, and diffuses any minor imperfections. I have very oily skin and I even like to wear this by itself when running errands. I like how it makes my foundation stay in place and I don't have to worry about touch ups."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","amuarox","Dallas,TX",4,"i can say this can be a cheaper replacement to the porefessional same effecta t a cheaper price, you do want to measure how much you use, if you palce too much on your face you will begin to see a white powder finish on your face (im a medium beige color)"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Tree","Shreveport, LA",3,"This product is average at best to me. I use it under my BB cream and it helps that to go on smoothly and gives me a nice finish but it does nothing to help control the oil on my nose. I think it works best for short-term makeup wear like going to run errands or something for only a few hours. I would not use this for extended wear such as going to work (7-8 hrs) or going out on weekends or special occasions when you want your makeup to look flawless all day long. If you tend to sweat, this product is not for you."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","moon122975","Detroit, MI",5,"I love this primer, it controls shine and keeps my makeup looking fresh most of the day. I've seen horrible reviews and I just don't understand. It doesn't smell at all and if it feels sticky and heavy on your face you are probably using too much or you are putting make up on before the primer dries. I have severely oily skin and I'm 41 years old, this covered my fine lines and wrinkles. I use it alone and with foundation powder."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-primer?productId=xlsImpprod4040053","Jojo","North Carolina",4,"When I put this on it makes my skin feel so soft and magical. It feels like I'm putting on silk, and it has some pore filling qualities. I put this on a few minutes before I do my foundation, and my makeup stays on all day. Sometimes I do have excess oil show through, but my skin has always been oily so I do not think it is the fault of the primer. Overall I adore the creamy texture of this product, and definitely would recommend buying!"
