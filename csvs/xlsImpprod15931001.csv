I was expecting more coverage but I found it to be very thin and almost watery. It didn't cover anything. It is pricey for no results. I wouldn't waste money on this one!"

An dot it on where you need it and pat it in and doesn't come off after your foundation goes on great for touch ups too."

I have fair/medium skin tone and wanted to try this for my undereye circles; the colors looked light for their shades so I got medium. Still way light. I'm definitely not any darker than a medium in ANYTHING. It settled into the small creases and just generally looked bad. Took it back. Blah."

This product makes my skin VERY greasy although I do not have oily skin. It is heavy that you can feel it. It doesn't blend well even with a try blending it with a wedge sponge."

It didn't cover my dark circles at alll!! It only lasted 2 to 3 hours on me. It didn't feel drying under my eye area but it just waayy too light coverage on me."

Also, when you try to put the cap back on, almost impossible not to click the tip and more concealer comes when it is not necessary."
"http://www.ulta.com/youth-fx-fill-blur-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod15931001","LC","America",2,"It didn't blur or fill anything. I tried it over moisturizer and over moisturizer followed by a color corrector. It was no better or worse than any other concealer I use. Maybe I don't understand concept of what concealer is supposed to do, but the shade deep, should be called deep caramel because that's about as deep as it gets. I'm not sure what this would look like on a person with dark skin but these MUA do amazing things!"
