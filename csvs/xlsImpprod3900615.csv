"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","JanB","Atlanta",4,"This is a very handy mirror. It is regular view on one side and magnifier on the other.  It is just the right size to hold in your hand."

"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","SexyCurls","Los Angeles, CA",4,"I use this mirror to do my makeup. I like that it has magnification side and normal side. It's easy to do my makeup with the regular side, and easily flip it to tweeze my eyebrows with the magnified size. The only thing that I don't like is that sometimes if I'm doing more complex looks, it takes me an hour and the mirror can get a little heavy to hold that long :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Becca","Evanston, il",5,"I love how the handles are soft and it s a two sided mirror. I use it to apply my makeup and when I do my hair it's pretty handy to use it to look at the back of my head."

"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Alby","Rogers, AR",4,"I use it to do my hair and makeup every day. It is convenient to take with me on trips for my hair and makeup. I do wish it was a 3x magnification instead of 5x.  I couldn't find a 3x when I bought this."
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Jilla","Texas",5,"A great mirror for applying makeup - sturdy but easy to hold one-handed."
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Cor","Orlando, FL",5,"My Sister was visiting and there aren't an abundance of store choices where she lives.  I had mentioned a recent shopping trip to Ulta and she started checking out the website.  When she came across her favorite makeup mirror from Revlon she told me how much she missed the one she broke.  I took her to the store where we found the mirror and she was overjoyed.  It's always great to find what you're looking for.  The next time she comes for a visit, I think we will be spending more time browsing."

"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","CC","Roselle IL",4,"the magnifer side is excellent... I had been using a mirror that was 15 years old, and wow !  what a difference."
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Traveler54","Swansea, Il",4,"I bought this mirror to replace the last of three that the handle had broken off. I was looking for something very sturdy with a handle. This mirror fits the bill. My only suggestions would be to make the actual mirror slightly larger."

"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Moongirl","Somewhere in the middle",5,"I wear glasses for seeing up close and the magnification side is PERFECT for putting on all my eye makeup.  I use the flip side for checking out the back of my hair.  It's sturdy, the handle is the perfect size and it's not too big, not too small.   I love this mirror."
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","iilynda","San Francisco, CA",5,"Cheap and its double sided. So far so good"
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Swisskitty","Scranton, PA",5,"Ergonomically perfect. I have it hanging on a hook in my bathroom. I like that it doesn't feel flimsy. I also prefer that the handle is static. I had one whose handle was adjustable. It was annoying and when I tried to tighten the screw, the whole mirror broke. OOPS!"
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Me me me me me","The great north",3,"The mirror surface itself is 5 inches in diameter.  10 1/2 inches refers to the top of the mirror to the bottom of the handle.  The back side of the mirror is a magnified mirror.<br />The front mirror has the word REVLON etched into the glass.  I find this annoying as it cuts into the amount of space I can use effectively."
"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","Bill","Buffalo, NY",4,"I find the description a little misleading &quot;Revlon Large Hand Mirror 10-1/2&quot;.  I assumed the mirror was 10-1/2&quot; in diameter.  It's not.  It's outside diameter is 6-1/4&quot; and the mirror glass itself is 5&quot;.  The mirror's overall length from end to end is 10-1/2&quot;.  The frame and handle are rubberized, easy to hold on to.  The magnified side is quite powerful.It appears to be a quality product. The one pictured looks pink, the one I received is black, which I'm happy for."

"http://www.ulta.com/large-10-12-hand-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3900615","MJ","Austin",5,"This is my favorite hand mirror ever! Easy on off hook for wall. Soft! The bouncy soft material around the handle and mirror not only makes it a dream to hold but it cushions the mirror too. Makes me feel safer if I accidentally knock it off the counter drop it or set it down roughly. These are a simple item I know....but these really are the shiz."

It has the perfect magnification for me."
