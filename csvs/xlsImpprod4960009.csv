I have had problems with this concealer creasing and melting because of my oily skin but a little extra powder in problem areas helps a lot. <br />However, I have fallen asleep in this concealer and it did not stay on. Definitely doesn't last 24 hours. With good setting powder it can last a solid 8 without looking gross though."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","JustJ","Hamburg, PA",5,"I use this for an everyday under eye concealer. I've had a lot of trouble finding an affordable concealer that is both pale and cool enough for my skin, but this is working well! It's not as creamy as a high end product, but if you're on a budget this works well for everyday."

I had to go home and wash it off. Worst concealer I've ever used"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","B","San Leandro",5,"I typically buy the brand name concealer but decided to try this one and was pleasantly surprised. It went on smoothly, coverage was good, and matched my skin tone well. The only con I found is that after some hours of wear, the color fades (and unveiled some of my hyper pigmentation.) Easy fix is to apply more. Price point is great and I will be purchasing again for daily use."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Fair-skinned Maid","FL",2,"I intended to use this product for covering blemishes, however I found that no amount of reapplying the product would hide them (specifically those that are raised). I would not recommend this product for use on small targeted spots, but rather for larger areas that are smoother like the under-eye area. I also recommend using with a powder because the product tends to be very dewy and sticky."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","SolaraJ","Virginia",5,"I use this concealer as foundation, it blends so well.  Sometimes I add a tiny bit of Becca shimmer to get a completely natural look.  Either way, it is a great foundation or just concealer!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Little Lin","Atlanta, Ga",4,"Definitely use this product with a wet beauty blender if you want it to blend easily. Also put a little on and blend it immediately because it dries fast if it isn't a thick layer. Also has a smell like that of acrylic paint, but it goes away after blending it in."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Amanda","New York",4,"I wasn't big on concealer till last year. This was the first one I bought but I wanted to test out different ones also. I bought two more and ended up hating them and went right back to the Revlon Color Stay. I'm already on my second bottle too. It blends in very well and it's not a heavy concealer. The color matches my skin perfectly. The only downside is that it does not last the whole day. It will get me through a full school day which is 6-7 hours but it does not really last much more then that. Usually I will have to reapply later in the day if I put it on in the morning and then I'm going out somewhere later. Other then that I love it and I will keep buying it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Lauren","Louisiana",5,"I use this concealer everyday under my eyes, on blemishes, and around my mouth.  I don't use foundation, just the concealer in those areas and it blends perfectly. Love this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Sophia","Augusta, GA",1,"I am very disapointed with this product. I am an NC45 in Mac or a mix of Toast and Caramel in Revlon colorstay foundation so when I was looking through the concealers they offer they only had one for dark skin tones. I assumed because they had such great foundation that the concealer would go great with the foundation I already have. I was wrong the concealer I got was in the color deep and it looks grey on my skin. I put it under my eyes and on some blemishes and it's too dark for me but the next lightest one is too light so they don't make a concealer for someone they make foundation for. Even if this was the correct color this is a horrible concealer because it is too shear and easily wipes off because its so greasy."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Frostymeadows","Raynham MA",3,"I purchased this because it looked like it would be long wearing, and it is. I use it to cover a scar, and sometimes puffy eyes or other imperfections. It lasts but it does not cover as well as other products I have used."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Rebecca","Chicago, IL",5,"This concealer covers my dark under eye circles very well.  It also stays put for an entire day! I have tried many brands to find a concealer that hides circles effectively and doesn't wear off, and I'm lucky to have stumbled upon this gem! Use a bit of powder on top and don't touch your face during the day, and this concealer stays put!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Noel Day","San Antonio, TX",4,"I like to use this product under my eyes after I apply my foundation.  I like that it really brightens my under eyes.  I don't like how much work it takes to get it to blend well, but it will eventually."

It just doesn't really cover that well in the first place and doesn't stay either. It's also really liquidy and I prefer something creamier."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Noel Day","San Antonio, TX",5,"I used this under my eyes, and as my highlight for my bridal photos and I loved it.  It looked so natural and it stayed matte and didn't clup or crease."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Audrey","Portland, OR",5,"I love this concealor! It covers well, stays on for a few hours, and is a nice color if you get the right one. You'll have to carry it in your purse if you want all-day coverage though, and you're better off using light foundation under eyes. It's great for blemishes and such though!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Arrielle","Atlanta",4,"this is a great concealer. Unlike high end brands that all come pritty much in yellow shades, Revlon has a variety of nuances.."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","kelleylovesboots","New York",5,"I discovered this in high school when I needed a concealer for blemishes.  After trying all the other drugstore brands with mediocre success, I tried this.  It was a bit more expensive than the others, but it WORKED.  You need to apply it in very thin layers, sometimes even using a q-tip for blending, but this will cover any blemish, broken capillary or spot.  <br /><br />I would not use it as an under eye concealer because it really dries out and would emphasize any fine lines.  It is not a moisturizing formula.  It stays put on oily or combo skin, and it does a great job, but not for under eyes.<br /><br />Seriously, this was a life changer when I disovered it and I am still using it about 15 years later.  Now that is staying power!"

I have extremely sensitive skin and rosatia and when I put this under my eyes it felt like it was burning on my skin. It doesn't cover any blemishes, and if you have sensitive skin and rosatia it will sting and burn your skin terribly like it did to mine. I am not sure if I am allergic to an ingredient in this product, but it is terrible and a waste of money."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","M","Michigan",5,"I have spent quite a bit on many brands of concealers trying to find one that will compliment my skin and not draw attention to the fine lines around my eyes that come with age.  I am almost 50 and am finding that the older I get, the harder it is to find product to help improve my skin tone that feels good on my face and doesn't draw more attention to the laugh lines that have been gracefully earned around my eyes ;-).  This is a wonderful product."

I have some sun damage which translates to redness (similar to rosacea) &amp; dark spots. This concealer covers both very well in just one coat. I dab it on with the sponge tip applicator and blend it with my fingers. One coat covers perfectly."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","CaityVanityy","Clearwater, FL",2,"THIS WAS SUCH A LETDOWN. I really liked the formula and how it felt on my skin, and it really blended well, and really covered up my spots, but after one day it broke me out :(( wouldn't recommend to acne prone skin at all!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Kate O","Mass",1,"VERY thin product. As soon as I put it on my blemishes, my skin soaks it in, and I have to put on another coat, then another coat, and another... By that point, it's still not full coverage. I put my face powder on afterwards, hoping that will cover the rest, but it makes it SO obvious I'm wearing a ton of concealer. I'm returning this product as soon as I'm finished typing this."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Tiff","SF Bay area",4,"Overall, I like this concealer. It does work for both under eyes and blemishes, but I prefer it for blemishes and spots. I use the Revlon whipped creme makeup and I love it, for many reasons so I wanted to try the concealer to see if i would have good luck with that too.. (I wear the &quot;natural beige&quot; makeup, and got the concealer in &quot;light&quot; for under eyes and &quot;light medium&quot; for face spots and they work well together!) I am happy because I often have a difficult time finding a good color match. <br /><br />I prefer this type of applicator for concealers, it feels like it is easy to put the right amount where I want it. I am confident I can put it in my little purse size makeup bag without it making a mess.<br /><br />I have no complaints on the blemish and spot coverage. I am prone to flakiness- I am happy to say, this concealer doesn't dry me out and cause the flakes. I dot it on all the areas I want to cover, then use a brush to blend it, and its like my face, without the spots. <br /><br />It covers my dark under eye circles well and doesn't dry me out. It creases a little at first, especially if I use it on my lids to correct the color there since I get darker on the inner corners (but honestly, most concealers in that area do crease a little) I feel like it takes awhile to set on my eye area. The up side to that is it is easy to blend and doesn't set too quickly...For some, you could probably remedy this with a setting powder. I prefer to use a setting spray since i have combination dry/ acne prone skin; powders make me look dry and cling to blemishes- they look flaky and worse than they did before makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Em","Columbia md",2,"A couple days ago I put this concealer on and it looked flawless what I put it on and half way through the day it turned into noticeable orange spots on my face. I tried it again to see if I did something to make it go like that but it happened again and again and again."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","JD423","Philadelphia, PA",5,"It's probably the thickest concealer I own, but as a result, it gives really great coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","yobri","Chicago, IL",1,"I absolutely love Revlon ColorStay foundation (whipped and regular) so I figured this would be just as great. WRONG! It's very easy to apply and there's a lot of product in the bottle but it doesn't blend well. Once I pat it into my skin, it settles in the creases immediately. After an hour, it breaks into sections on my face where you can see patches of concealer all over my under eyes. It also dries me out, especially on my forehead and above my eyebrows. I don't have oily nor dry skin, it is normal and I have found that my skin type is very compatible with a lot of makeup. I find myself trying to get my moneys worth using it again and again knowing that it's just going to ruin my face makeup. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I feel like concealer will either be a hit or miss. Spend your money well elsewhere on concealer."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","crimsonrose51","Kilgore, Texas",5,"Great coverage. Easy to use. Easy to color match to my skin tone (very fair). Long lasting. Available for purchase at a lot of stores. However I don't like the applicator. If I touch applicator to an acne blemish then dip it into the concealer, it could get bacteria into the container. I deposit the amount of concealer to the back of my hand and apply with a concealer brush to avoid bacteria contamination."

I feel like Revlon tries really hard to make a good product but then comes out with a really terrible one. this concealer is sheer which can be expected. Luckily it's just my exact skin color so I apply it as a triangle and then use a beauty blender to soften the edges of it then I set it really quickly for extra coverage around my dark circles. As a spot or discoloration concealer is better rather and an under concealer"

I've tried many times to like this product but I just can't seem to like it. It doesn't last all day. It's creases even after it is set. It settles into fine lines. There's just nothing good about this concealer."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","naz","chicago, il",4,"This concealer was not that long lasting, since it has a sheer light formula that is not thick, it will crease if you apply too much under your eyes, BUT it  is perfect for highlighing the bridge of your nose, and highlighting your face and it will look gorgeous once set with a long lasting loose poweder! I give it a 8/10 since it is not long lasting, BUT it can be if you do add powder on top."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Abi:)","Rome",4,"I love this concealer! Covers my dark circles very easily and stays on for as long as I need it too and I don't even have to set it with powder. It also works as an eyeshadow primer. The only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't cover acne very well and will come off quickly on pimples."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Phoebe","Milwaukee, wi",1,"Not 24 hour coverage... Doesn't even stay on for 10 minutes after applying it. It wipes right off. It's too liquidy for anything besides under the eye concealer."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Tanya","Fort Drum, NY",1,"I bought this as an under eye concealer.  It did seem to cover well when applied. I didn't like that it felt like it never dried and the moistness from it caused my mascara to transfer during the day.  This would probably work for someone who sets concealer with a powder.  I have another concealer that does better and dries to a satin finish so this just went in the trash."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Miss Kelly Renee","Los Angeles",3,"When I get this concealer in the right color, it blends just fine. I have no issues with it.<br />However, I accidentally got one that was too light for me and decided to repurpose it for a highlight shade. However, it looks super cakey and it feels heavy as well as makes my skin tingle. Granted, that tinglyness goes away but yeah, it sure doesn't feel great.<br />I don't think I will buy this again, but I don't hate it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Robyn","Central Virginia",1,"This is fine as an under-eye concealer. The problem is that is is very moist or oily or something, and after only a couple of hours I end up with big smudges of mascara under my eyes.  This doesn't happen with the other concealers I use. Maybe if you wore water-proof mascara, it would be OK."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Annette55","Port Huron, MI",4,"I use mostly for under eye circles. It works a swell as any other concealer that I've used. It has a a convenient sponge applicator, although my personal preference is a brush. Up close you can see that it settles in creases, but an overall better appearance than those dark purple circles!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","ally","Yorkville IL",2,"I wanted to love this product, but I was horribly disappointed. I cannot keep it from creasing under my eyes. I've tried using primer, and setting it with powder but nothing works. However I have found myself using it for highlighting elsewhere (my nose, cheekbones, forehead, etc.) and it works well for that. If you're looking for a well rounded or under eye concealer, this is not for you."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","JustaGirlWhoLikestoFeelPrettySometimes","Omaha, NE",5,"I tend to try different foundation/concealer combinations constantly because I have very oily skin and by the end of the day my face is melting off. I've tried everything from &quot;for oily skin&quot; to &quot;acne clearing&quot; to expensive &quot;clay&quot; foundations/concealers. Whether those are selling tactics or they flat out don't work, I have yet to find a concealer that does the job without caking or being too see through. I don't wear a lot of make up, but I do like to look complete. This concealer does that for me. It's a thicker, tackier, but VERY blend-able formula. It gives a full coverage look without being too heavy. I apply with a wet blender and it works great. No creasing or caking. I recommend giving this product a try. My Ulta is discontinuing certain colors so I hope that doesn't mean they're eliminating it completely. Hard to find inexpensive beauty products."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Emma","Cleveland, OH",2,"Once you apply it over your foundation (which I used the Revlon Colorstay Foundation), it seems to work well at first. It blends well into the skin and the applicator was easy to work with. Then a couple hours later, it's like you never put it on. I put it under my eyes, the bridge of my nose, my chin, and on my forehead. All of that was gone and you could only see very obvious clumps around my nose, where my skin gets very dry. My skin was well moisturized and primed beforehand, and I even tried this concealer a couple more times. I tried baking with loose translucent powder, I tried setting it with pigmented press powder that matched my skin tone, and nothing worked. I would not recommend this if you have dry skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Ris","Canton OH",1,"This isn't a good cover up, I used it for under my eyes and it didn't cover. Poor coverage. Wouldn't get again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","Kylie","Ann Arbor",5,"It's the only concealer that truly matches my skin, similar to the color stay foundation. I like it for under eyes and concealing pimples."

Thought this was going to be a great concealer based on other reviews but I found it completely unblendable.  Didn't hide anything and made my under eye area feel really dry.  I did return this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod4960009","LT","Fort Wayne, IN",4,"I really like this concealer. The only issue that I had with it was that it wouldn't stay on over some blemishes but for the most part, it stayed on everywhere and blended great. I'm an athlete and it even stayed on during my games."
