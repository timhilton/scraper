"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","J M","Texas",5,"This foundation is surprisingly amazing. I was hesitant, mostly because it is hard to buy the right color and a lot of foundations feel heavy and icky. This stuff is great. Coverage is buildable, color is true and stays (no turning orange!), and it feels nice on my skin. I live in south Texas, this stuff doesn't run or leave me feeling greasy. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend trying it out for yourself. :)"

This product is long lasting, easy to apply and blend, and more. The only problem is that it's sticky to the touch even after applying powder."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","LuluNJ","NJ",5,"I'm in my early 30s and have sensitive combo/oily skin, and prone to breakouts. I've tried some high end products to drugstore brands because I don't have the luxury to buy high end products all the time. And this is the best all day oil controling, matte foundation I've used by far even compared to some of the high end brands I've tried. I spray some deslick setting spray on my damp sponge and apply, and it looks great all day. (I only do medium coverage for a more natural look)."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","HM89","ohio",5,"I'm actually very pleased with this. I've been trying alot of expensive foundations lately trying to find the right one and i've had no luck. So I decided to just buy a cheap one and found it to be much better. All the expensive brands were melting off my face and making me look greasy. This did not do that, nor did I break out. I got ivory and it's pretty light. Definitely has a pink under tone. It's also more of a light coverage. I've always been a fan of revlon I shouldve known it would be nice."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Mands","New York",5,"I have oily/combination skin which used to mean I had to carry blotting paper with me as I had to blot about 2-3 times on a regular day to get rid of the shine on the forehead. I noticed a difference with this foundation straight away. It goes on easily and blends beautifully whether you prefer just some light coverage or build up for medium or full coverage. The finish is matte to start off with and for someone with oily/combination skin like me it usually starts looking dewy after about 3-4 hours. The foundation holds for a good 8-9 hours - usually I am pleasantly surprised at how &quot;fresh&quot; the foundation still looks when I am about to take my make up off after work."

It lasts all day, goes on nicely, and makes my skin look amazing but sadly it causes my skin to break out.

I am in the shade buff that shade is a little litter than my neck but once I put my powder and contour it looks like the perfect shade. My skin is oily and some dry spots on some of the acne areas of my face. It clings on to dry patches that's fur sure so I wouldn't recommend this to people with dry skin. I say that it's a must to apply prime or else your oils will break down the makeup this happens around my nose but even though it breaks down it doesn't look horrible and that's why I love this foundation and it has a pump!!!"

I always get compliments on how great my skin looks and how airbrushed I look. I have some acne and redness with quite a few of pores and this foundation covers it.  I love that now it has a pump! This foundation does the same or even better than a higher end foundation. You must try it!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","MDH","Texas",4,"I love this foundation. I've tried expensive name brand makeup and this tops them all. I don't have to touch up my makeup all day and it still looks fresh at the end of the work day. Frequently I'll touch up a little powder and mascara and then I'm set for the night. I blend my regular and summer color for the spring and fall when I'm starting to get or lose a tan, so that I have the right color match all year."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Sally Ann","Shreveport, Louisiana",5,"This foundation is streaky if applied with a brush that isn't super dense, but goes super well with a sponge. It dries quickly, so you have to work fast before it dries. It is very long lasting and builadble, but the oily version does stick to dry patches. I have extreme combo/oily skin, which means that I have dry patches but get extremely oily in my t zone."

There isn't a shade that is light enough for me so I have to mix it, but that is the only con. I've been using this for years on and off and I keep coming back to it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","aaw0422","Westland, MI",5,"I love wearing this foundation. Its light weight and great for everyday use. I have dark spots that i am able to conceal with not having to pack on alot of foundation. One of the best inexpensive foundations to use. I have combination skin and it works very well. I have recommended this foundation and it was a success for that person as well."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","E Jones","Greensboro, NC",4,"I have extremely fair, sensitive, combo oily skin with very red and pink undertones. This foundation covers my redness and leaves my skin looking flawless ALL DAY! I have been looking for a foundation that would work well with my oily t zone and this is the one.  Love it Love it Love it! I had originally purchased Too Faced Born This Way because of the amazing reviews and don't get me wrong, it's great, but it causes severe break outs on my chin and it doesn't stay nearly as well as this one."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Josie","Los Angeles, CA",5,"I have tried different drugstore foundations for around four years and this one best suits my skin. I have combo skin that used to be much drier. This foundation is definitely full coverage and would not recommend to those who are looking for a natural look. I use this on most days of the week. It does get oily after time but that is why you use loose/setting/pressed powder. Without powder it is &quot;dewy,&quot; which does not look bad but does move more, say, if you touch your face. I apply this foundation with a beauty blender, which I think is best. I love this foundation and think it is the best among most drugstore foundations you can find, at least for my preferences and skin type."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","VoldeMorticia","Albuquerque, NM",4,"I'm liking this foundation better than other high end foundations I have tried. It lasts about 11 hours on my greasy skin. My powder products blend out totally fine on top of it. It does tend to look a bit heavy up close but maybe it's because I set my face with powder."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Arwyn","Los Angeles, CA",5,"I have tried long and hard to find a foundation that works for me at the drugstore, which is hard because I don't like spending $10 or more on ANY makeup product. Maybelline, elf, CoverGirl, their foundations all failed me. This is the only one I've found that will stay on the entire day.<br /><br />I work up to six hour shifts combined with going to school, and this foundation stays put through all of that. It doesn't ever get greasy, only a bit dewy, and that's after sweating away in a food service job.<br /><br />You can build up the coverage to however much you want, it blends easily (best to apply with a beauty blender), and you don't even feel it on your face. This is foundation I will take with me to the grave."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Makeup Queen","Vacaville,Ca",5,"Love this foundation! It's amazing and I don't know why I didn't try it sooner. I picked it up because a co-worker told me it was really good and she used it on her clients when she did makeup. I got it because I was having a hard time finding the right shade in higher end foundations and one that was best for my skin. Gave it a shot and this is my third bottle I'm on. It gives my skin a nice healthy glow, my makeup lasts from the time I put it on until I take it off without touching up, it's a medium to high medium coverage, it gives you a nice satin Matte finish, easy to apply and blends in great, controls my oil amazing and outbeats my high end foundations, it actually matches my skin! I'm a pale princess and it's so hard to actually find a foundation that matches my skin but to find one that's drugstore is huge! The colors are always way too dark, or super yellow toned. I find myself reaching for this over my higher end foundations. Love that this has a pump as well. I was super impressed when it held up in 90 degree heat that we had 3 days ago."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Elena","San Ysido",3,"I was expecting too much from this foundation, what happened to me is that it only lasted for 3 or 4 hours which is so little, and the worst part is that it started to break on my skin which made it look too ugly. That is a no no for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Hannah","Oregon",4,"This foundation is one of the best I have tried. It goes on easily (love the pump) and has good coverage for how lightweight it feels. It makes my skin feel like it doesn't have foundation on, and won't melt off onto my fingers when I touch my face. I have an oily forehead and nose with dry patches on my chin and under my eyebrows. With previous foundations, the product with cake up on the dry areas and become slick and shiny throughout the day. The Revlon foundation has impressed me by having little to no cakeyness on dry areas and preventing my face from becoming greasy and slick. A great quality foundation overall."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Vanessa","Milford Mi",5,"I have bought at least 15 expensive foundations, then one day mine exploded and my friend handed hers to me. I WAS HOOKED"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Rho","Birmingham, Al",5,"I went searching for a liquid foundation that would give  me great coverage and not make my face oily<br />Let me add, I have EXTREMELY oily skin on my face. This is the FIRST foundation I've found that does that at a great price! Definitely worth the $11 or $12 I spent! It stays on all day without making my face oily. It also blends really well!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Erin","Chicago, IL",4,"This is the best drugstore foundation I have found after trying many and it's the only one I've even considered repurchasing. The coverage is great, it stays on pretty well, doesn't get patchy, and has pretty good oil control. The only complaint I have is that I have to mix colors to get the color right but that's not too bothersome considering how well it works. The only reason I'm taking off a star is because occasionally this foundation does get cakey around my nose...it's probably just my skin though not the foundation's fault. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend as a good long lasting foundation. It's great for special occasions too!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","scrapperluv","Nashville, Tennessee",5,"I was using MAC's full-coverage foundation and was on the hunt for something more affordable but just as good. I Googled it and found this as a recommendation. Perfect! A fraction of the cost, has full coverage and doesn't slide off my oily skin. I have large pores and sensitive/acne prone skin, so I need good coverage and this make me look flawless. <br />Little word of warning. I think this might cause a little bit of breakouts. Not horrible and no more than the comparable MAC product, and the coverage is worth it for me. I dust over it with Maybelline Matte-poreless powder for normal-oily skin. Really, the combo is flawless."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Maymay","Visalia,ca",4,"I use this foundation religiously for everyday use. The price is awesome for the amount of coverage it gives. I can build coverage as well for night time use. It has never made me break out, and doesn't transfer really. Overall I think anyone with acne/sensitive skin should try this out. Good for beginners too who are looking to practice medium to full coverage application without paying huge prices for foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","AKB179","Pittsburgh, PA",5,"This is the absolute best foundation. I wanted an everyday go-to foundation, and this is it! Stays on great and easy to apply. Love how it has a pump too- it makes it so much easier to use. Does a great job at keeping the shine away as well. This foundation is way better than infallible, true match, and ready set gorgeous."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Jaz","CA",4,"Love it?"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Porcelain Pale","Minnesota",5,"I always have a hard time finding foundations, as I am quite pale. Most brands, when you get to the lighter end of the color scale, get very yellow based. I use Ivory and it matches perfectly. I love that this foundation can be applied in a thin layer, but also a little thicker to get a heavier coverage. It never feels heavy or cakey to me, just light and comfortable. It doesn't dry out my skin either, which is a huge bonus. By far, my favorite foundation (and I have tried out quite a few to find one that worked). I'd definitely recommend this!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Zona","Queens, NY",4,"This foundation definitely has staying power.  It doesn't rub off easily which is what I wanted.  It did rub a little bit on my collar, but not too much. The color I chose is a great match to my skin, and the coverage is very good. It did not make my skin oily, and it goes on a little satiny, but is easily matted out with setting powder. It blends well.  This is a good foundation for people on a budget that want staying power, good coverage on a budget."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Jackie","Braintree, Ma",5,"I have always bought expensive foundations this is one of the cheapest I bought and it's my favorite! It stays on all day and is great coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Momma Michele","Milwaukie, Oregon",5,"Matte all day 10+ hours. I did use primer and set with powder and finishing spray, but probably not necessary. Blends out nice and easily with beauty sponge. Didn't try it with a brush because I prefer foundation application with a slightly damp sponge.  I used a cream contour on top and powder blush, bronzer and highlighter, they all applied beautifully.  This covered my rosatia and skin blemishes without any color correction.  This is my first time purchasing and I'm super pleased."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","ne-ne","Philly Pa",5,"I bought this a few years ago after trying every drugstore brand that they sell and this is the best. It stays on for a solid 8+ hours and I have extremely oily skin so that's amazing. It doesn't feel heavy and doesn't come off until you want it to. I have never experienced an increase in breakouts after using it just perfect looking skin. I was very excited to see it in a pump now because the only downside of the product was having to pour it out which wasted a lot of product. I have recommended it to everyone I know"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Lilah","Orlando, FL",4,"I mix this foundation with a drop of my concealer to get the perfect consistency &amp; coverage I need. The foundation is great by itself, but like with most brands, I don't have an exact match in color just because I have a very unique skin tone. I am usually a brand buyer and will drop $30-$50 on a foundation without hesitation, but I tried this out for my daily makeup routine and it's phenomenal-dare I say, better than the pricier brands!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","DS1030","Troy,NY",5,"This foundation is perfect for me (combo/sensitive skin)! The coverage is light to med but it is buildable. I just go back in on areas I need more coverage. I apply with a beauty sponge after primer. Lasts all day with a setting power! I would not recommend without a powder over the top because it sets slightly sticky. My face looks perfect all day, no breaking up or transfer!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Fifi","Niagara Falls, NY",5,"I just recently discovered this foundation and it is amazing for my oily t-zone. I apply my foundation at 7am five days a week for my office job and with other foundations by 10am I am oily and need to blot. Also by 10am the oil that has built up on my face around my nose has pushed my foundation aside and that area is without foundation for the rest of the day. I don't know what's in this stuff, but it stays on all day and my oily skin doesn't break it down - I am smooth and matte all day, even in my very oily t-zone area. So glad I heeded the words of Wayne Goss and gave this a try!<br /><br />Also I have rosacea so I need medium to full coverage. I apply the first layer all over my face and then I build a second light layer across my nose and cheeks only to completely conceal my rosacea all day. Fantastic!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","ANC01","San Francisco, CA",5,"Repurchase this time and time again.  The shade range is so good, almost so that I never know which foundation is my best match,  I have oily/acne prone skin and always need matte foundations to wear.  This isn't 100% mattifying and after a 10 hour day it definitely isn't full coverage and matte anymore but it still gets the job done for everyday wear.  Doesn't cause breakouts and the fact that it has a pump makes it 10x greater"

I was using Mary Kay cream to powder but it started making my skin look  muddy. I haven't used a liquid foundation  in years but after not finding another compact type foundation that worked for me , I tried this. I'm 63 and it makes me look 20 years younger!  After a long day it still looks great.  Gotta say it again . LOVE IT."

I don't have a problem with acne, but need full coverage for acne scars and this foundation is perfect for me.  I have tried GA Luminous Silk. KVD Lock It, Makeup Forever Ultra HD, full coverage foundation from ulta's competitor, and MAC Studio Fix and every time I wind up coming back to this as my go-to foundation.  This goes on very smoothly with a damp beauty blender and then it needs to be set with a powder or it will transfer.  I set it with Ben Nye banana powder. Most days I don't even need concealer!  I would definitely recommend this!!"

It provides full coverage and lasts several hours before breaking down. It's not super buildable, though, and I've found that if I go back in after it dries and try to apply more over a trouble spot, the foundation will come off."

It isnt heavy but covers mostly everything. I stay matte allll day too. Seriously, i can put this on in the morning and be confident that it's gonna look good until i take it off. My tip is don't use too much setting powder or it will look too dry. And of course use moisturizer beforehand."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","KountryKaitin","Seal Beach",4,"First off, this product really is long lasting. I like that you can chose between skin types normal/dry and combo/oily. I'm the latter. And once I put this on in the morning I don't usually do any touch ups the rest of the day, unless I have a special occasion. Second, I realized the trick with this stuff is a little goes a long way, if you use too much it just ends up smearing everywhere. With that said, use as little as possible and spot apply for special areas that need a little more attention. It really does a great job at covering breakouts and has a nice color range. Overall, definitely one of my favorite foundations for sure!"

Nothing beats this foundation in terms of coverage, color matching, and longevity.  It's a medium-full coverage foundation that looks like I have no makeup on at all! It stays put and does not settle into pores. You can even use it sparingly or mixed with moisturizer for more sheer coverage and it still blends very well. I have fair skin and Buff is a perfect shade for me in the winter - and it doesn't make me look like a ghost like many fair shades of other foundations do. Ironically, I have dry/very dry skin and I find that the combo/oily skin formulation works great for me, as long as I wear my usual layers of moisturizer and facial oil.  It dries to a velvet finish and keeps my skin looking fresh all day."

I bought it once on a whim and was absolutely amazed how long it lasted on my combination skin. I have an oily t-zone and it is hard for me to find a foundation that does not break up as the day goes by. <br /><br />Used by itself and a setting powder, it stays all day. When I use it with Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, I can literally sleep with this make up on and wake up looking almost the same as when I went to bed. <br /><br />I love that it is so versatile. I can apply it with a brush for full coverage (it is highly pigmented for a drugstore brand), or use a damp beauty blender/sponge for light to medium coverage. It also does not oxidize on my skin as some other foundations tend to. The only downfall is that it DOES contain Titanium Dioxide so it creates flashback with flash photography. <br /><br />Revlon, you have a customer for life!"

I actually have dry right now because of the winder. I get oily in the summer. <br /><br />it is hard for me to blend using a brush. I highly recommend using a beauty blender or a real tech sponge. lightly buff it into your skin with the damp sponge. <br /><br />it dries fairly quick and doesn't seem to be too matte that it flakes. 1 pump is light, 2 pumps is medium, and 3 is full. but use a damp sponge or you'll look like cake if you use a brush! and let it set before you &quot;bake&quot; your face. <br /><br />it is long lasting. I've worn it for 12 hours and it seems to hold up pretty well for drug store make up. it's not flawless, but it's holding on really well! <br /><br />I gave it 4 stars just because I had a really hard time blending it out with a brush. i used a lot more product with my brush than the sponge. I am not a fan of putting make up on with a sponge. <br /><br />I've been using Maybelline fit me foundation matte finish and I like this foundation a lot better just because it isn't as drying and it last longer."

I tried a new foundation twice and didn't like it as much never got any compliments and recently tried it again and yeah I'm never trying any other foundation.

Even during my worst breakouts this makes my skin look even and glowing! Seriously, this foundation will make you look like a porcelain doll...

Myself as well as many others are not happy about this. It was such a great foundation. I compared my old bottle from a few months ago to my new bottle and the ingredients are definitely different. I also went to 3 different stores to test the foundation and it is much runnier now. If the product was getting too expensive to produce, a price raise would have been better than runny and thin foundation. I used to only need 1 pump, but now I need 3. I am disappointed in this change and will not be purchasing this, or any Revlon foundation until the formula is thicker."

I usually buy brand name make up, but I read a good review about this foundation while researching the best makeup for combination skin and had to try it. For me, it works better than any other brand I have tried, including Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, IT Cosmetics.. I love all of those brands but this one definitely stands out. I have combination skin, my nose tends to get very oily throughout the day while my cheeks and chin are dry and flaky. This foundation keeps my face matte through 12+ hour, busy shifts without having to blot and the dry areas never flake. I love this foundation and will definitely continue to buy."

It made my skin look so even and had good coverage. A few days later I went to take off the lid and the pump came out and made my whole room a mess. After a few weeks of using this my skin became very dry and started breaking out. I have relatively sensitive skin but this started to burn when I applied it and caused my face to be extremely dry and flakey. Would not recommend!"

My skin can get oily, but I have dry patches within it. So oily nose but peals as well. This foundation works great for me. Sometimes I don't moisturize when in a rush and this still works great. This foundation also evens out my skin tone. I have used this with primer and without. The benefit of primer is it will blend even smoother. I use a big foundation brush (not the flat one) to apply. Works well in humid summers and dry winters in Chicago."

I have experimented with many different drugstore brands and have never been satisfied with a product to buy it more that once but Revlon ColorStay changed that for me. It's the first foundation I've found that has a shade that truly matches my skin tone and it lasts well throughout my day. So far I've purchased four bottles and I plan on continuing to use this product for a while. Keep in mind though that I do beauty on a budget, I've never spent more than $15 on a single product so none of my experience is in comparison to more upscale brands."

I have tried every &quot;matte&quot; foundation, setting spray, and primer. This foundation worked well at first but after about 2 weeks of using it I had to switch. The coverage is great when you first put it on but it creases terribly, and the oils from my skin break it up within an hour of wearing it giving my pores a magnified look and an overall greasy look to my face. Which is ultimately what I am trying to avoid. I had high hopes for this foundation but the only real perk to it is coverage."

However, when I used this product, I stayed looking shine free all day. I love that it has medium to buildable coverage without caking up.

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Des","San Antonio, TX",4,"After using MAC studio fix for about 9 years, I decided that it was time to look for something else. I have acne prone and oily skin, and studio fix did not help that at all. <br /><br />After using colorstay for about a week, I can tell you guys that I haven't had any breakouts on my face. This is not something that I was able to say when I was wearing studio fix. It's like I was breaking out every other day. This foundation dries to the skin, and gives you a matte finish. This allows people with oily skin to get more wear out of the foundation. Studio fix did not dry matte, and I had to use lots of powder over it to make it look matte. With colorstay, I only apply powder under my eyes for a brightening effect. I don't have to apply powder to my normally oily t-zone, because this stuff keeps it dry. I am finally able to wear a moisturizer under my make up without worrying that it will make my skin look oily. In fact, I find that when I do add powder all over my face when using this foundation, my face gets very oily within a few hours. <br /><br />**TIP: Do not wet your sponge when applying this foundation. It will mess up the formula, and cause the foundation to roll up like dry skin on your face. I know that this technique is used to make foundation look natural, but this foundation already looks very natural. Apply it with a dry sponge."

I had heard that the Revlon Colorstay formula had been revamped and was pretty good compared to the old formula.  I gave it a try and wow what a difference! When applied with a damp sponge, it goes on so smoothly and evenly.  It blends out like a dream.  The cool thing is that it really does have buildable coverage.  It starts out a bit light, but you can definitely add more product to places that need it and it won't get too cakey (tbh any foundation will get cakey if you put on enough...). It stays put all day and using a primer and powder helps too.  It doesn't get patchy in areas if your face gets oily throughout the day either. <br /><br />Overall, it's a very nice drugstore foundation and totally worth the price paid for it.  If you have oily skin, this might be a good option for you!"

I've tried matte, drug store ones, I've tried high end such as Urban decay and this is a lot better in coverage. They finally got the pump which is easier to apply because it is heavy, so I just use two small pumps. I wasn't looking for full coverage but once you use it, you'll love how your skin looks, and I started using it because I saw a few beauty bloggers raving about it."

It goes over them flawlessly and it was such an awesome moment because I have dry patches around my nose and cheeks a lot. I have combination skin so I get a bit oily , but I live in the blazing hot and humid Florida so my skin gets more oily than it should. I first wore this on Halloween, the best test because you're out all night and it's hot! This. Foundation. Did. Not. Move. After hours and hours it still looked just as flawless as it did when I first applied it. That's saying a lot! It makes me look like at doll and covers everything. Absolutely Medium to full coverage.

This foundation beat the heat! I've gone for walks in the middle of a hot Florida day wearing this foundation, it did not budge. I smeared sun block over this foundation, it did not budge. I've used the Maybelline Fit Me foundation for a while and always hated how it settled into fine lines, so I watched closely for that with this Revlon foundations. It did not settle into my fine lines. I was amazed! It looks and feels natural. I just love it, so happy I tried it."

This foundation is so light,  with great coverage.  I'm constantly getting complimented on my skin appearance and flawlessness of my foundation.  I don't usually review items,  but this is a must.

First off, I've been using this since I was in high school. Ever since they switched to the pump version of the foundation... They also changed the formula. Now I don't know what the heck to use as a foundation....it doesn't even stay matte. I use smash box photo primer, and even then my foundation starts to melt off my face and I get oily. For people who are interested... Don't waste your time if you have an oily face. The old version without the pump and formula was amzing. Now I have to invest in a new foundation and waste money trying to find a new one that has a matte finish. I couldn't be more disappointed and upset with Revlon.

It melts right into my skin and looks like I have a perfecting filter on all day and it's got SPF in it but doesn't ghost me out when I take pics! My only tip is scrub well bevagse I had a few pimples after a few wears."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Anon","New Orleans, LA",4,"This is a pretty good product. I switched over to this after using Revlon's foundation for oily skin, I hadn't been a fan of the formula, it was really thin but heavy and you'd has to layer it on to get a fair amount of coverage. With the Combo-Oily I get the amount of coverage I need(I'd say medium in 2 layers) without the heavy feeling. I like that it comes with a pump, although two or three times it has gotten stuck and so the foundation would spurt out suddenly. I have fairly oily combination skin, and normally this foundation will last several hours with a powder and a little blotting, but I also don't have a primer. However, starting in the summer I started using Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen(???) and it has kept me pretty matte and oil-free and my makeup lasts almost all day now. Please note that I use this foundation usually just on my t-zone and as a spot-concealer. So it's a pretty good foundation and I will buy it again, but make sure you have a primer, mattifying sunscreen, or powder to wear with it. If you have less oily skin than me it may last longer"

However, after using this product, I agree with the bad reviews. It is very hard to blend this product in. I have tried a blending sponge, my fingers, and a foundation brush. It also is very cakey once it is applied and and makes my skin look gross. It keeps flaking around my nose and on my forehead. I also noticed it has a very strong smell and it drives me nuts to go all day being able to smell my own foundation on my face."

I used it exclusively for years and recently rediscovered it. After using it once, I'm wondering why I tried anything else. The new formula is quite a bit thinner, but I haven't had any problems with it. It's still the same amazing product. It looks like skin, the finish is semi-matte and natural, and it doesn't budge through eight hours of hard work and even some sweat. I barely have to touch up all day and unlike with literally every other foundation, I'm not a greasy mess by the end of my shift. Doesn't oxidize on you. Only possible caveat: It dries fast, so work quickly while applying. Blend, blend, blend. I'm fair to light skinned, and &quot;buff&quot; is my perfect shade. It looks really light and even a little grey in the bottle, but magically becomes perfect on the skin. Neutral undertone. One of only a few truly incredible foundations at the drug store."

It blends perfectly with my skin tone, covers the redness of my acne well (with little bit of concealer underneath on the really bad zits), and works perfectly with a beauty blender. My skin does get a tiny bit oily by the end of the day, but the foundation stays on regardless, and it's nothing a blotting paper can't take care of. It has a pleasant smell, and I love the pump-style bottle. The only tiny con is that it takes a while to set, about 10 minutes. (I'm always rushing in the morning, so it's a little inconvenient).

I don't set it with powder unless I'm baking and I never wear foundation without lotion on my face so it all melts into my skin nicely. Honestly I'd compare this to Naked skin where the UD Naked Skin is so lightweight and build able coverage and I only ever need 1 pump for each foundation. I used the colorstay foundation for almost a year until I switched to Naked Skin and now back to Revlon and I'm saving so much money for practically, in my opinion the same thing. I personally think the UD foundation is the best on the high end market for the price and the only differences I find are the scent (Revlon is much better) and the consistency. Naked skin was very watery whereas the Colorstay foundation was more whipped. Anyways, I prefer the colorstay foundation now over anything and it's so affordable. Bless"

I personally have used this brand for years and by far was my favorite and I've been noticing with the new formula that it's just not as great anymore. They should have left the formula alone. If someone wanted SPF then they could wear that as a base layer. It can always be added in but it can't be taken out. Bad move Revlon."

At the time, I was strictly using drugstore makeup and had never even thought about purchasing high end. That all changed when my Mom bought me the Urban Decay Naked palette for Christmas in 2014. From then on I was addicted to buying and trying high end makeup. I wanted to see what else I was missing out on. So I started a 1 year long journey of buying several different high end foundations. I tried Makeup Forever, Becca, Urban Decay, Tarte, Lorac, Too Faced, and Benefit, just to name a few. I liked a few of those but nothing was ever so amazing that I ended my search. Then, a few weeks ago I was looking at some pictures (selfies lol) on one of my old phones and could not believe how AMAZING my skin looked! I didn't realize how dull and blah my skin looked this past year until I saw the old pictures. It took me a little while but I realized it was because of the foundation. (I tried buying new blushes and highlighters and they made no difference.) I immediately ran out to Ulta and bought a bottle of my old favorite and used it the very next day. I was SO EXCITED to see that glowing flawless skin again! I will NEVER waste my money on any other foundation again. The coverage is amazing and it never looks heavy or cakey. I LOVE this stuff!"

I will say that ALL of the expensive foundations that i've tried, they're so much harder to match my skin tone or it's not full coverage or some other reason that it's not to my liking.  To my surprise, the shades ColorStay has is right on &amp; it's extremely great coverage for the $10-$13 price depending on where you get it. I will reccomend this to anyone who wears foundation on a daily basis and doesn't want to break the bank."

I looked oily right after applying and throughout the day, even after powdering and blotting occasionally. my skin isn't even extremely oily so I can't imagine what the result would be with skin that is! in addition, this transfers so easily! onto fingers, clothing, ANYTHING! it just comes off!

For it to work nicely on my face, I have to moisturize, prime, apply a powder for a finish, and then spray on a setting spray.

I tried this a few years back before it was reformulated, and I have had such awful luck with foundation lately I decided to give this a try. I have very, very tricky-to-match fair, combination skin so it's virtually impossible for me to find foundation that will not dry my dry spots, melt off in my oily ones, can match my skin &amp; not oxidize, and last all day through the southern humidity and long work days. This. Stuff. Is. Gold. I love this! I've been applying it with a damp Real Techniques sponge and it covers all of my discoloration beautifully and dries to a beauty Demi-matte finish which I can easily make luminous or perfectly matte. And I'm here to tell you, I will put this on at 6 am, go through my entire day (including a sweaty workout and humidity) and this foundation will not have budged. I've also noticed I have not had too bad of a problem with this foundation transferring, either. I will DEFINITELY be repurchasing this foundation! Drugstore goldmine."

Cause I watched a reviews on this product on YouTube before purchasing. Many warned about possible oxidizing with the skin and caution to get a fee shades that you believe are close to skin type, and to make sure the place where you are buying will take returns on open makeup. I have a combination skin type, because i normally get dry during winter and get super oily during the spring/summer. I love how it can easily built on in layers and the matte finish it gives. I will say if you have strong oily skin during seasons. Then, just add a setting powder for extra insurance on the safe side. Overall I love this product a lot, and I would definitely purchase again with the price being in a good range for someone starting out in a great liquid foundation. It does cover up problem areas and it helps to tone down any dark spots or circles."

I would call this foundation a light coverage (no longer medium to full). I think you could reach medium coverage, but would require a lot of product. It also gets cakey very easily if you try to build up coverage. I also noticed it transferred more than the original version as well. I am so very sad about this change.

I love that it lasts all day and comes off with a face towel, soap and water. Does not cause me any breakouts and the added SPF is a plus.<br />This is the first time it has had the pump design, so I am not sure if I will like that better or not."

Later at night I took it off and noticed red bumps on my face that itched like crazy. This is the second colorstay product I try and the same has happend both time. It sucks because the coverage is BEAUTIFUL. Ill still give it all stars because I think it works perfect for most people."

But lately when I've been doing my makeup, I've been reaching for this foundation. Excellent coverage for my badly scarred face and perfect oily skin! I actually had this foundation on this past Friday, I did my makeup around 11am, went to work until 9pm and then went for drinks and dancing until 1am. When I got home my makeup was still in tact and I didn't use any oil blotting sheets or powders to touch up throughout the day. Trust and believe I'm typically always reaching for oil blotting sheets! So if you are looking for a great foundation that lasts all day, I would definitely recommend this one. <br /><br />Oh yea! The &quot;only issue&quot; with this foundation is that is does run off, but no matter I do with my foundation it always has color transfer in my clothes, so I'm just careful."

For reference I'm a nc15 and use the shade 150 buff (it's pretty neutral however). Smells a little like paint, also does feel somewhat heavy, but it does provide a decent amount of coverage, medium to medium full. You could probably go light medium with a dampened sponge/beauty blender. The main gripe I have about this foundation is its blendability, it's not bad, but it's not super easy as say hourglass' immaculate. It will slightly cling to dry spots. I have dry skin and have tried the dry/normal? Skin version and actually did not like it as much. It lasts pretty long on the skin for me, enough to get through a day of work/school, but won't take me through a whole day and night.

It flaked all over my face and settled into fine lines. It also left my face looking ashy and malnourished. It was a no-go.I hated it so much that I tried using it for about two weeks and ended up throwing it in the trash.<br /><br />One of my favorite youtube users recently mentioned that she mixes the Colorstay for oily skin with a high end foundation in order to get a decent shade match. Realizing that I had previously purchased the dry formula, I decided to go out and get the foundation for oily skin. What a difference! I mix this foundation with one of my expensive foundations, and the result lasts all day. I don't even need to powder! If you like a super matte finish, then this foundation is for you. I personally prefer a slight &quot;glow&quot; and therefore mix it with EL Double Wear Light. This product is worth a shot considering it ranges from $8-$12. Can't go wrong with that price!"

While it is when I put it on initially, I find that during the day and throughout, it turns darker than what the pigment originally was. The lady who grabbed it for me also got the Oily/Combination type when I have Norma/Dry skin, so it makes my skin peely and flaky. When I wear it to school, the coverage slowly goes away and my red areas become apparent. But, when initially put on, it's got decent coverage for all of those red areas."

With that being said, i absolutely love this product and have repurchased several times. I use to use Benefits's Hello Flawless Oxygen WOW foundation but have switched to this. Both are great, but Revlon's price tag is nicer for continuous use. The only issue i really have with this foundation is that sometimes it sticks to my dry patches when i have them. Other than that, This product is amazing and i Would recommend it to anyone. It lasts all day for me but i do use a face primer so without it, it lasts almost as long but not quite."

Another way of saying it was that my color looked too uniform across my face and it lost all dimension, even with just a thin layer of the product.

The 180 is too much of a pink undertone while the 150 is very light, wish there was an in-between shade! Other than that, I love the product, and the finish is flawless and last forever.

I used a matte foundation by Boots and I still got oily throughout the day but not with this one! The finish look of this is great and if you do want to finish it off with a powder it looks great still. I have acne, acne marks and a very uneven complexion and this product covers all of that. It's definitely full coverage. For me, it doesn't cake up at all. I would say the only down part is finding your perfect shade. Since it is a drug store foundation you can't have someone personally help you match your skin tone but it's really all about knowing your under tones and your skin tone. Definitely will continue to use this as always, I always try different foundations, but this is definitely one of my top 5."

Since i picked the right color ( you need to pick the lighter color from your shade because this one gets a little darker when it dry just like MAC) I never thought i would like a foundation from the drugstore.

This foundation clung to any little dry patch (some that i didn't even know i had) so maybe this would be better for oily skin instead.

It blends so well with amazing coverage. This is the first foundation to have full coverage yet leave my skin to natural look. It doesn't fade or easily wipe off. The only down side is when washing it off because the foundation attached to the skin pretty good."

I love the matte finish of this foundation and I really love how light weight it feels on the skin considering how thick the formula is. This is a full coverage foundation and a little goes a long way. The fact that it worked to well at keeping my oil at bay is why I love it. The fact that you literally have to scrub your face off to get this foundation off is why I hate it but would recommended to anyone."

It is somewhat difficult to coax out of the bottle.  Thankfully it does have good coverage so a little goes a long way.  It is a little tacky, though, so I find a damp blending sponge works best to get it blended right.  The color is a perfect match for me.  My only other critique is that even with powder and a mattifying setting spray, my face still ends up shiny at the end of my 8 hour work day."

I don't hesitate to invest in high end make up, and I spent lots of time researching what would be the perfect foundation for me. I tend to continue buying make up on a never ending search for perfection. I have fair skin with redness and freckles, and it can get quite oily and shiney. I was searching for a heavy for coverage foundation with matte finish that would last for my whole day- I leave the house at 8 and don't get home until 9 or so. I have tried high end (Est&eacute;e lauder, tarte, bare minerals, urban decay etc) to drug store- and this foundation is it. I kept checking it throughout the day and was just blown away. It it good coverage and buildable but feels lightweight and silky. I loved my Est&eacute;e lauder for its coverage and staying power but it felt like a mask. This feels natural and applies like a dream with my beauty blender. Just a midday blot and I was perfectly refreshed. I especially liked how it seemed to help my other make up stay- my blush was perfect for my entire work day. With other foundations it tended to fade.  I even went for a run after work and after heavy sweating it still looked surprisingly decent. I am returning my high end foundation purchases and won't be without this again."

I've only ever heard great things about this foundation, but this was seriously such a letdown. I don't usually buy drugstore foundation since it's difficult to find the right color for my skintone, but after getting a recommendation for it from another fair-skinned woman, I figured I'd give it a shot. I tried the shade Buff, since I knew Ivory would be too pink for me, but Buff is EXTREMELY yellow. I have a very neutral undertone, but in the summer I tend to get slightly more yellow. This almost made me orange. It did not blend easily and the marketing on the store shelf said this had a matte finish? Absolutely not. I would describe the finish as &quot;dewy in the wrong way.&quot; It did cover all redness (with a second layer in a couple spots) and it does last. However, I am used to my foundation setting slightly without a powder, and this does not do that. Until you use a powder, your face will feel heavy and slightly tacky. I will likely be returning this."

It's pretty heavy coverage, but I like that. I have very oily skin so throughout the day, most foundations tend to separate on my skin. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I'll find little patches of oil where the make up has kind of congealed. <br /><br />Regardless, this is one of the first foundations that stays on with little need to touch up all day. I love it. I have my Chanel and this at home and can say that I reach for this one more often than the other. <br /><br />I wish it came in a pump, though, as I don't like having to work hard to get the product out.

I have the lightest shade and it basically makes my face pink. Along with that it is soooo cakey it is unbelievable. I goes on very patchy (I've tried a flat top brush &amp; beauty blender with it) and it just doesn't work. This is not good for combo skin either. It WILL cling to every single dry patch and make it 100x worse. I am very picky about my foundations but this was very disappointing."

It's full coverage and matte, so a little goes a long way.  It also sets very quickly. I recommend a primer and not using fingers to blend - if I use a primer and beauty blender, I don't see oxidation later in the day. I don't need much concealer.

I have used this for about 2 years now and I don't want to try anything else. Before, I was switching all the time or trying to find added ways to reduce shine. I love this stuff and will continue to purchase. Price is great and normally will last about 3-4 months for me."

I like to use it with buffer brush, spraying my brush with fix+ and buff it all over..it gives it more sheer natural finish. I have combination skin &amp; it works great with it too."

I went ahead and wore this for months, it was fine, I didn't love it but didn't hate it until I started getting comments from people saying &quot;you have a makeup lines on your face&quot;. I'd look in the mirror and the makeup would turn bright orange and get blotchy on my fair skin regardless of the shade I used. I gave it a for more shots before I gave up and switched to Revlon Photoready foundation which worked a lot better for my skin as far as drugstore foundations are concerned."

Drugstore fails: loriel lumini, true match(liked ok), loriel liquid to powder (showed every line in my face).  High end: tarte, urban decay, it cosmetics,....all oily within a few hours.  Turned to youtube to find out what others are using and came across a blogger who fell in love with Revlon colorstay 1.) because she isn't oily in 2 hours 2.) a flawless finish for hours.  I ordered 180 Sand and the color matches my skin PERFECT!<br /><br />I have applied with fingers, brush and beauty blender, and found I love the finish of the beauty blender best.(although it does waste product)  I have had so many compliments on how flawless my skin is.  I have very uneven skin tone with red blotches around my cheeks and chin....this stuff covers them right up with one layer.  I KNEW I found the right foundation after first use.  I do use a finishing powder (cheapie from elf cosmetics) on top to seal the deal....do not touch up all day,  ALL DAY!!!!! Now that is awesome!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Sabrina the cosmetologist","New Jersey",4,"I have used this product for the past 5 years. I have probably bought about 15 bottles. I think this foundation smooths out your skin, it gives medium coverage with about 2 thin layers, but it is most definitely build-able enough to give full coverage. I would say it lasts a solid 8 hours on oily skin. Its not that the makeup fades a lot, it just starts to break up and look like a splotchy, runny mess if you dont powder yourself down every couple of hours. Even though it gets messy on me sometimes, I still stick by this product. It is the best drugstore foundation I have ever used and I will repurchase this again and again."

I was using the L'Oreal Lumi foundation but I began to notice that only after having it on not even an hour I would just look like my face was DRENCHED in oil! (YUCK!) So after a lot of review reading, YouTube watching, blog searching I was lead to this foundation. I was worried about reviews saying it was hard to blend. I disagree! This foundation is SO easy to blend out, and it is buildable for those who like their foundation thick. It keeps my face COMPLETELY matte YES for 24 HOURS! The first night I wore it I got nothing but compliments and I even fell asleep wearing it (DO NOT RECCOMEND) and it was still on! The only things negative I would have to say is that it doesn't come with a pump but it's really not that hard to get the product out. And if you have oily acne prone skin like myself you absolutely HAVE to remove this make-up off at night!! Other than that is foundation is absolutely fabulous. Recommend it to all my friends now!"

It goes on smoothly, it makes my skin look amazing, and I must say, if you are getting photographs taken, this is the best (as long as you get NO SPF). I got some pictures back and OH MY... It gives you the look of glowing within, just absolutely amazing. The two things I do not like, is that I can find my perfect shade, but when it dries, it deoxidizes, and leaves me with an entirely different color. The other thing is that there isn't a pump. I really hate that. It is a great product though. It also does fade after awhile, but just comparing this to the Urban Decay foundation, this one lasts twice as long, easily."

It doesn't break me out, make me orange, or wear off throughout the day like all other products I've used. I use an Ulta Color Correcting Foundation &amp; Primer Stick before applying this foundation so that my skin tone is more even. This foundation goes on smooth and does not require a lot. My only concern is that it is rather messy. I'd much rather have it in a pump bottle format. However, I'm willing to deal with that considering how well it's worked for me."

I have tried so many expensive foundations and never thought about Revlon. I use a primer before use and of course apply with a foundation brush. I have oily skin and it last all day and provides smooth even coverage and I don't have to worry about shine like I experienced with Bobbi Brown &amp; MAC. I live in the South with harsh hot summers and it last even with me sweating really bad. I even went swimming at a pool party and it stayed on!! The caveat is that it is difficult to remove hence the name &quot;colorstay&quot; so just make sure you use a good facial cleanser to remove it. The week I started wearing it several of my co-workers asked what was I doing different to my face because it looked so good. I told them it was just a foundation change.

The last thing I had was a mousse foundation and an Olay/Covergirl that wore off pretty badly. <br /><br />I saw a lot of people recommend this so I picked up a bottle in Nude. <br />I love it! When I first put it on I despaired because it was a little tacky and I've had bad experience with American BB cream. But it set wonderfully and was indeed matte, but not in the chalky way that mousse or powder can be. <br /><br />My biggest love is the lasting power and the color. I have pale skin with a lot of red all over so even if a makeup fixes the red in my face, suddenly my face looks nothing like the rest of me. This makeup reduces the redness wonderfully but matches the underlying skin tone and doesn't &quot;white out&quot; the redness of my cheeks so my face doesn't look unnaturally different than the rest of me. And it lasts all day! I teach and I put it on an hour before work and when I take it off before bed it's still there. It does last longer where my face isn't oily but places like my forehead easily make it through the evening. <br /><br />I couldn't be happier and I will purchase this for a very long time!"

I honestly could not live without this foundation. I prefer the combo/oily formula over the normal/dry formula which is too thin and watery and doesn't provide as much coverage.

Also it may just be my face but this product feels greasy to me and makes me not want to touch my face or have anything near my face for fear of it rubbing off.

I was worried since the only real oily part of skin is my T-Zone and my cheeks and forehead are dry.  Come to find out that the Colorstay for Combo/Oily skin is perfect!  Easy to apply, easy to sheer out if you want lighter coverage, very blendable, non-cakey, matte but not dry AND stays on all day.  What more can I ask for!  If you have combo oily/dry skin, definately give this one a try.  It's perfect and doesn't cost a lot of $$$"

I've tried a blending blush, a beauty blender and using my own hands to apply it. It's not even worth buying."

I thought it was good until I ran a half marathon in the dead of summer heat and humidity....and then I was IMPRESSED! I ran 13.1 miles (in record heat temps) wearing this foundation and it did not budge! I even wore a hat and there was no funky demarcation line where the hat sat on my forehead. One of the female race volunteers even did a double take at my face and was impressed that my makeup was still intact. <br /><br />The foundation provides medium to full coverage. It can be difficult to blend, so I dab the foundation on to one section of my face at a time and blend it in with a stippling brush and that does the trick. My only complaint is that it takes a little bit of effort wiping it off at night with a makeup wipe (my only reason for giving it 4 loves instead of 5). <br /><br />I'm generally a &quot;brand snob&quot; and was hesitant to try this foundation, but I'm glad I took the chance.

I find myself touching up when i wear any foundation other than this one. i wish the pigmentation wasn't so pink or i just need to mix two shades to get one that suits my undertone. other than that, im in love and ill alwasy go back to this product! try it out. its great for oily or acne prone skin"

I specifically bought this because the ingredients on the bottle said it MAY CONTAIN Titanium Dioxide and other flashback-causing ingredients. <br />I wore this foundation for a while - coverage is good but you have to be careful to not apply too much (I found using a damp sponge helped a lot). I bought it in Ivory and it matched my skin tone perfectly. It held up well after very long shifts in a vet clinic and helped control my oily skin.<br />However, I just recently wore it out to dinner where pictures with flash were used - I GOT SO WASHED OUT. You could very clearly see where my makeup was and where it wasn't. I was VERY frustrated with the fact that the bottle itself says it MAY contain TDO, when obviously it does contain it, and in large enough quantities to make me look like a ghost. <br />As long as you're not planning on having your picture taken with flash, I think this is a good foundation."

When I first applied it, it felt great - really light on my face, and almost completely matched my skin tone (I got it in Toast, and I'm an NC44 in MAC).I was well impressed with its wearing capacity: stayed on for nearly 12 hours without budging and when I travelled with it, I noticed that it looked better when I got off the plane that when I was boarding it !<br /><br />But I think all these initial successes made me blind to its other more fallible faults. After a few days, I noticed my pores were looking quite large and I was starting to break out really badly. I have sensitive skin and am prone to acne sometimes, but have never broken out to this extent. I think it was because the makeup was clogging my pores. It's really unfortunate, because for the price, this was a really good buy."

I decided to purchase the combination/oily skin one in 360 golden caramel because in the summertime I am really oily. I like this one a little better than the normal/dry skin because it lasts on my face a little longer.

I was sick of paying a ton for foundations that wouldn't last on my face all day, the only one that had was MACs pro long wear but a lot of their foundations leave people with an orange tint in the medium skin tones. This gave spectacular results, even matte finish without looking caked on. I use a duo fibre brush to apply and that helps keep the foundation a bit less cakey (it's a VERY thick fluid). So if you're looking for all day wear and willing to battle the bottle to get the foundation out, you'll be pleased!"

I will say that it keeps me matte for a fairly long time (I have extremely oily skin), and it matches my fair skin tone better than any other drugstore foundation. Otherwise, the finish looks very cakey, it always comes out streaky, it makes your pores stand out and its extremely difficult to apply. Definitely won't be repurchasing."

It's a bargain and a staple in my makeup bag. I feel bad when women say it breaks them out, because I could not live without this product. Even after the reformulation, which was unfortunate, it is still amazing. It is buildable, giving medium to full coverage, depending on the look you wish to achieve. I prefer to pat it into my skin with a Beauty Blender, but I can also make it work with a brush or just my fingers. It dries to a semi-matte finish, and I top it off with Rimmel Stay Matte pressed powder. Stays ALL DAY long, and I work 12 hour shifts in a hospital. I also own MAC Studio Fix fluid foundation but prefer to save it for more special occasions as it is pricier, so Revlon ColorStay is my everday HG foundation.

I do wear lotion underneath in the winter as it's rather drying, but in the summer it does great by itself - doesn't make my face an oil slick."

It has, in my opinion, a light to medium coverage. I don't really need much coverage, just enough to even out my skin and I'll double it up on my breakout spots when needed and it's great. I use the Real Techniques sponge to apply this foundation and it blends like a dream. <br /><br />The only con about this foundation is that it isn't long lasting and oxidizes weird-ly. I work a full time schedule, and keep in mind I have oily skin, and by the end of the day, my face looks a bit blotchy and cakey; only at the end of the day. Not quite sure if it's the powder I use to set it, but I have tested it with two different powders and the same results come from both.<br /><br />Overall, a definite 4 out of 5 stars."

I have VERY oily skin, makeup never stayed on my face until I found this. I can work out in the yard, sweat my butt off and my makeup still looks great! It's so cheap, there's no reason not to try it. I do set mine with a mineral powder because I like a very matte look. I've also notice that my face feels smoother and softer since I started using this product. Plus I have ance prone skin and have not had any issues with breakouts, which I was worried about when it recommended you use a makeup remover when washing it off."

I have been using this since 2011 I believe &amp; just a month or two ago I bought Macs studio fix &amp; I only used that for about 2 weeks. It had good coverage but the smell was bad &amp; the lady at the counter must have color matched me wrong bc when I actually applied it myself it looked waaaaay to orange toned. So I went back to this &amp; this is some really good stuff!!!! I can't live without it! I always get compliments at work on how my skin looks great! Definitely recommend this to ladies with oily skin!"

Anything is worth a try at this point. I tried Color Stay 400 Caramel.  I did not blot all day!!!  My co-workers noticed I didn't have a shine.

This seems to be everyones favorite foundation, and I'd have to say I'm converted. This is my first foundation where my skintone matches 100 percent! I was wearing it today with moisturizure and powder. Though the powder was sweated mostly off, the foundation lasted all day with no trouble. I've heard you have to work quickly with it, but I didn't experience anything. I've never really cared for Revlon, but this is a definite repurchase. My only issue is that I'm not used to bottled foundation, so it may be difficult to dispense once I begin to run out."

If I ever find myself unable to afford IT and Tarte, I will go back to Revlon Colorstay.  I used shade 150 BUFF in Revlon and that shade matched me perfectly.  I have had issues with finding this perfect shade with other brands, but in Tarte I use the Fair Sand shade or the Light Sand shade.  The Revlon foundation provided a great matte finish for my oily skin and I used to use Clinique's loose powder in the invisible blend.  Now I use either IT Finishing Powder or Laura Geller's powder in the compact.  If you are looking for a budget friendly makeup that is great for oily skin and stays on all day, then Revlon Colorstay is the perfect product."

I am giving it another try because the first time I broke out it was that time of the month and I always break out then and the next I slept in my makeup so I'm hoping it's not the foundation! Another thing is I used my mac powder to set it and my face looked soooo powdery and cakey. I used my loreal pressed powder and that seemed to work better with it. Overall a great product though!"

Fortunately, I have been able to avoid buying high-end foundation because of this stuff. I have pretty oily skin, and I deal with some minor acne every so often. I struggle to stay matte during the day, and this foundation is the best I've tried! It is full coverage, and I pair it with a mattifying primer, and it is perfect. I use a flat top buffing brush to really buff this stuff into my skin, and it looks great. I have never broken out while using this. The only con to this product is the fact that it is a little heavy, but that is to be expected from a full-coverage foundation, so it's hard for me to even say that's a con. <br />This is my &quot;go to&quot; foundation, I will buy this over and over again. If you struggle with oil &amp; acne, and want more coverage, definitely try this stuff before you try more expensive alternatives."

I want so badly to love this. It truely is a full coverage and budget friendly foundation. However I'm struggling with it but it may just the way I apply it. <br /><br />I use dr. brandt pores no more primer then apply this with a damp beauty blender. I use mac studio fix concealer then set my under eye with dermablend powder. <br /><br />The finished look however is just odd. It's pretty facelike around my nose and chin and really inhances my pores.  On the other hand I really love how smooth it feels and that I don't need to set my whole face. I am a long time lover of loreal's true match but wanted a little better matte coverage than that provides. I'm going to try applying with a brush and without primer maybe those are the issue."

THE SECOND DAY IT ACTUALLY DRIED MY FACE AND IT LOOKED CAKEY EVEN MY BOYFRIEND AND DAD NOTICED!!!

It's full-coverage without being cakey, lasts all day (won't rub off if you tried), goes on smooth, is buildable, and looks natural. You can't ask for more, especially for the price.<br /><br />My only complaint: the shades aren't consistent. I got the &quot;buff&quot; shade in the &quot;dry skin&quot; type, and it was perfect for me. When that ran out, I accidentally got the same shade in the &quot;combo/oily&quot; type, and they are not the same shade. The &quot;dry&quot; colorstay foundation is quite a lot lighter than the &quot;combo/oily&quot; one. At the drugstore, I looked at all the colorstay foundations and saw that the shades varied quite a lot, even though they were supposed to be the same shade. So be careful when picking out your match, and don't assume that the same shade will work next time you buy it.<br /><br />Other than that oversight, this foundation is perfection. Not too heavy for summer, and you won't sweat it off, which is great."

I have used a few drugstore foundations but none of them have been able to match up to this one. It is very easy to use and blends so nicely onto my skin. A couple of things that I need my foundation to do is to have good coverage (I have a lot of redness and tend to breakout), not get cakey when I apply a second layer of foundation, doesn't transfer (i.e. getting it all over a white t-shirt), and to keep my oily skin in check. For the most part, this foundation has been able to do that. I'm not a fan of full coverage makeup but this foundation covers my redness so well while still making it look very natural. It's very buildable and won't get cakey or make your face look dry when applying a second layer. It doesn't transfer onto clothes which is good! No one wants your foundation rubbing off onto their clothes.  Not so much in keeping my oily skin in control but it does a lot better job than most foundations I've used. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a pump, so it's kind of hard getting the product out of the bottle. Other than that, I love this foundation!"

This stays on all day and is full coverage. It helps keep my oil at bay. I apply this with my kabuki flat top brush for a airbrush finish.

I have combination/oily skin, and no other foundation has kept my skin looking as matte as this one. I use E.L.F's powder brush to blend it out (only three dollars; you should buy it) and gives me a flawless finish. I also use this on my eyelids as a primer and it covers the discoloration/veins and keeps my eyeshadow crease-free. Keep in mind that you may need to purchase two shades and mix them together to get the perfect match for your skin. Another thing is that it can end up being a little patchy/cakey by the end of the day. Other than that, it's a great foundation and I highly recommend it!"

With that being said, what I love most about this foundation is it does NOT LOOK like my makeup is dripping off even though it might be! It has a nice matte finish and is definitely buildable. Again, with that said, it does tend to look a little cachey as you layer it, but I find that a little goes a long way. I really do find that just a couple drops provides strong medium coverage and gives you a nice natural looking finish! LOVE LOVE LOVE.

I did a lot of research based on product reviews for various products accessible in drugstores since I can't afford anything expensive. As I sifted through reviews via product website and blogs, I realized that Revlon has modified the ingredients of this particular foundation to this current 24 hrs one. The mixture is quite thick, but a little goes a long way. I applied it with a brush at first, but it left streak marks and I found that just using my fingers to blend gave me better coverage. It covers my blemishes and neutralizes uneven skin tone and I always feel confident using it when my skin isn't being cooperative. <br /><br />After my first bottle I bought another one but the weight was so much lighter, and the color tint was darker and it dried my skin out. It appeared to be the exact same shade, and I kept comparing the two bottles...but then I realized, there's an *SPF one and one without for combination/oily skin. The SPF one was the one that went on smoothly, and maintained the oiliness of my skin. It gives a great matte finish that appears as natural as liquid foundation can give. The other one without SPF seems fit for those that have oily skin because it applies very very thinly compared to the SPF one and it dries my skin out a little too much since I deal with combination skin."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Makeup junkie","Los Angeles, CA",5,"This product provides amazing coverage at such a great price! This is by far the best drugstore foundation out there if you're looking for full coverage. The product is very thick, but it dries on your skin very quickly and doesn't feel heavy at all. It leaves you with a great matte finish that doesn't cake up. It's super long lasting, the only downside is that it is somewhat difficult to wash off."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","gp","Boston, MA",1,"After reading the glowing reviews and hearing about this foundation non-stop on Youtube and beauty blogs, I was super excited to try it. However, I was extremely disappointed. Although the formula is supposed to be for combo/oily skin, I found it extremely greasy and the consistency extremely thin and watery. I will say the coverage was good, but it was very hard to blend and sort of just sat on my skin. The color match was also very strange. I am a MAC NC15, and bought the color 150 Buff. It seemed like a good match at first, but after a few minutes on my skin, it turned into a grayish-green color. The biggest con of all was the longevity. Even with primer and setting spray, it barely lasted three hours on my skin before totally fading off. For a foundation that claims to wear 16 hours, I was very disappointed. Will not repurchase."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Cait","Tampa, FL",4,"This is literally the only foundation I use. I have tried many foundations from many different brands, but this is by far my favorite. I have very oily skin, and this foundation does not slip off, even if I forget to powder my face. I rarely use a primer because they break me out, and it doesn't really set into my fine lines. I love this stuff. It can be very light coverage if used with a damp sponge, but if you layer it, it is great full coverage too. The best part is, is it does not feel heavy on my face at all. It is a light formula, which I love. I never walk out of the house without this foundation on. It evens my skin tone and is the perfect shade for me. The only downside to this is that it does not mattify my very oily face. But with a light dusting of powder, I am perfectly fine. Overall, if you want a great foundation for a good price, I suggest this!"

I don't normally ware liquid foundation because of my dry skin but I really like this foundation.  It absolutely lasts all day and I would say its a full coverage makeup but others might think it's more medium coverage.  My only issue is when I first dot it on my face it kind of itches, but that goes away when I blend it together.  I have also never been able to find my exact shade 110 was way too pink and 220 seems slightly too yellow so I might have to find 2 shades to mix.  <br />*I don't ever look dried out or oily and I also do not set it with any powder"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Nathalie","Minneapolis, MN",2,"After my skin began to act up my junior year in high school, I thought it would be wise to switch to something that all the youtube gurus rave about for its coverage: Revlon Colorstay. I was satisfied with this for about a year, before I realized that it was creating all the acne it was covering up. This stuff is really thick and difficult to apply and it also has a rancid, chemical-like scent which becomes more bearable once it dries. Despite the fact that this is made for &quot;combination/oily skin&quot; it made my skin incredibly oily. I never really considered my skin to be oily until using this product. It caked up around my nose and highlighted the clogged pores on top of my nose. One positive thing I have to say is that it is full coverage, which I preferred at the time, and it also very long lasting. It is so long lasting and powerful that it is practically impossible to take off. When I would wear this, I would basically have to scrub my skin off with a cleanser, exfoliant, AND a toner. This totally stripped my skin. Not to mention the long list of ingredients, some of which are phthalates....which is basically a type of plastic....I don't want to put that on my face....<br /><br />My skin has improved greatly since I've stopped using this product. Though I may have given this a bad review, this is just my personal experience using it. I know some people really love this product. I, however, do not. Now that I'm in college, I don't have time to apply a full face of makeup, so I stick to cruelty-free BB and CC creams."

I purchased two bottles of that same shade at ulta because i couldnt find it at my local drugstore. <br /><br />When I applied it i noticed it had a cool tone. I checked again with the first bottle i ever bought and they were so different. almost the same color, but different undertone. the two bottles i bought were cool tone!!!!

I have tried multiple foundations over the years, but this one is my tried and true.

I put it on the back of my hand, sometimes blending two shades.  Then I work quickly to apply a thin layer of foundation using a damp foundation brush.  <br /><br />In my experience, using a good damp foundation brush and using a very small amount of foundation will give the best results.  Finger application or make-up sponge application looked too heavy.  The foundation brush was a great investment and made all the difference.  <br /><br />This foundation sets quickly, so work fast, and blend.  You can then go back and add another thin layer, or just build up the coverage where needed using a damp concealer brush.  Set with powder and forget about it.  This is not ready to slide off my nose and chin by the end of the day.  <br /><br />A big challenge for me, always, is getting a good skin tone match.

There is a lot of people that say it feels &quot;heavy&quot; however I don't find its any heavier than liquid foundation. If your comparing it to a loose mineral powder then yes, it will seem heavier but that's not a &quot;con&quot; it's the type of foundation. I put a lightweight moisturizer on first. Apply foundation with a stippling brush, let it dry for a minute then blot any excessive off so it's less &quot;dewy&quot; looking. I apply a finishing powder and go or some bronzer. By the evening it still looks great! I have an oily nose so I have to blot that once or twice in the day but other than that it's great!"

I know some people swear by it, but I just can't get behind it. Firstly, it made me break out, so I just can't wear it. Aside from that it's SO easy to put on too much and you're left with a mask of foundation. Even when you don't think you've got much on your foundation brush it can quickly become very heavy-handed. <br />That said, it really does last all day.

The coverage is wonderful and for a person who has oily skin after 1 hour after I apply makeup, I get absolutely no oil whatsoever, and I've had it on for over 10 hours. Thank you revlon!

Since I have the oiliest skin known to man I didn't expect too much from it. It stayed put and looked flawless for about an hour or two. In a way it worked well because it did keep the oil away the entire night but I looked liked never applied a thick layer of foundation, which I have to do to cover my scars. I will probably still use it to control some of my shine but not as a stand alone foundation."

It does a good job of controlling my oily face, even after six hours (though my skin starts to look dewy after 4 hours). I apply very little but I still get good covrage. I like that I can build it up to full coverage or sheer it out for every day. It has a scent like markers in the bottle but when applied to the face, I don't smell anything. It has low SPF which is okay for flash photography."

Due to the thickness of the product, it can take a little getting used to in order to get the finish just right.   This foundation is very buildable to full coverage, and I sometimes will mix in a little bit of a BB cream before applying if I want a lighter, more dewey finish.  I recommend using a stippling brush for a super flawless face.  I have a rather oily T-zone, and I rarely have to blot throughout the day, and it stays put for well beyond 8 hours!

I used to think that with two washes of make up remover would suffice but thats not the case! I haven't found any good make up removers that can completely take it off with just 2 washes. And I learned the hard way when I started breaking out. I thought it was the product itself but after research online with other users, it was because that there was still traces of the foundation left on my skin. Once I've learned it was because of that, my skin hasn't broke out. And my skin is prone to that. If you purchase this, I highly recommend the best remover, toilettes, and or brush to completely remove the foundation. I live by this product! I've used really expensive products from Chanel, HD, etc and not even that compared to its coverage or price combination of the product. I have acne scar skin and this has been the best cover up foundation I've found. I'm done looking for any other types of foundation."

I overlook it because of how well it works, but if smell is an issue for you, you may dislike this. I do wish it came in a pump bottle though instead of a screw off lid. Not a big deal since you can buy your own to reuse, but it'd be nice if it already came that way. It's just a preference.

I do have oily skin so when I blot my makeup, some does come off (but that's just life). It stays on much longer than the L'oreal True Match foundation, and it's coverage is much better too. I recommend this for girls (or boys) with acne and have oily/combination skin. It really blends seamlessly and doesn't look like it is caked on. I use my hands to apply the foundation which seems to work just fine because I don't want to waste product with a brush. If you're having trouble finding a good match, I actually used the new Revlon Nearly Naked foundation matcher because they use similar shades to find it, as well as Temptalia by using it's foundation matrix. (It's an online makeup blog, check it out!). Overall this has been my favorite liquid foundation, and truly isn't heavy or cakey like others have said."

This product is best applied with hands or a damp sponge, it dries a little too quickly for use with a brush unless you work very quickly.  I love this product because it wears very well and lasts throughout the day without looking heavy, greasy, or unnatural.

The medium tan colors always come out with pink undertones and leave my face a little white. And the deeper colors all make you look orange.

Overall,  I think revlon focused too much on getting their foundation for the right skin types and totally forgot about undertones and colors."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","MissMakeup","Boston, MA",4,"I heard a lot of reviews about this foundation, and it lives up to the hype of all of them! I was looking for something that would give me a flawless, airbrushed finish without feeling heavy or greasy, and this foundation is it! It is highly pigmented and offers full coverage with a solid range of colors to choose from. It took me a couple tries to find the right one for me, but luckily Ulta has a great return/exchange policy to make the color selection process hassle-free. My only con is that as the foundation is drying, it can feel a little tacky, so I have to get used to not touching my face while it's setting, otherwise it messes up the finish of the foundation. Also, I am used to using loose mineral powder foundations, and I was not aware that this liquid foundation would take the color of bronzers and blushes MUCH more easily, so I have to have a lighter hand with that. Otherwise, I love this foundation and will continue to repurchase it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","kram","Dublin, CA",5,"The Revlon Colorstay foundation for oily/combo skin is an amazing drugstore foundation. The coverage for this product is light-medium, but it is buildable. I mix a small amount with my Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture for Combo skin to make my own tinted moisturizer for oily skin. I then use my Urban Decay De Slick S.S and Mac Blot Powder. This minimizes the oil production and my makeup oxidizes less. I do see my foundation oxidize a little around the eyebrows, but not as bad as my MAC Studio Fix Powder Foundation or Too Faced BB Cream. The only downsides to this product is that when you take it off, I feel like it's still on my face. (I use my Clarisonic to clean my face, and there is a small amount left) and it might be causing acne for me. Im not sure if it's this or my diet, but I have been getting small (but not noticable) pimples on my cheeks, which I never get. It may be my diet though, i've gotten a little carried away with junk food :)<br /><br />5/5"

The only thing is I have to get the foundation for normal/oily skin when I acutally have dry skin because the shade Mocha does not come in the dry skin formula. Other than that I love it!"

Previously I avoided wearing a full face of foundation because it always felt heavy.  But this is weightless.  There are 20 colors so you should have no trouble finding one that suits you.  It is probably not the best for dry skin since it dries pretty quickly.  But for normal or combo skin, it's wonderful."

I tend to have a hard time finding a foundation for my oily skin that will match and won't cause break outs. Trust me forget the expensive department brands. This is a keeper. My husband loved the way my skin looked after my first use. Great coverage without the heavy makeup feeling."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Franny","rsm, ca",5,"WOW. I love this product. I used to use MAC Studio Finish dry compact since I was 18 years old -1996. Now I am 34 and the studio fix was settling into those happy little expression lines and I was on a hunt to find something else besides a powder (I do not like the liquid Studio Fix at all). I researched numerous websites for great foundations and brand vs. budget Dupes, and they all came back to this. I used the sand beige and it blends in perfectly with my skin tone. You can layer it for a sheer coverage or a heavy coverage if you are going out at night. It leaves my skin luminous. No breakouts. Covers. 1 coat covers red but still leaves a bit of my freckles through, perfect for weekend. For work or going out at night, I obviously use a few more swipes. I tell you, I have never liked drugstore foundations or makeup and have always bought dept. store brands, but this, my friends, is amazing."

The foundation itself if truly comparable to a department store brand.  It lasts all day, doesn't leave skin feeling (or looking) greasy.  The biggest problem I have with this foundation is the lack of colors to pick from.  I have warm undertones, and EVERY shade of Revlon's Colorstay Foundation has pink (cool) undertones.  It clashes with my skin and makes it look like I'm wearing a mask.  Overall the product is good, IF you have the right skin tone to fit Revlon's limited range.  Revlon, PLEASE make more shades of this great product!"

Foundation has a matte finish and dried quite quickly so application can be a bit tricky.  Only 4 stars here, though.  Although the foundation seems to dry quickly, it does feel a bit heavy and tacky on the skin although it's been set for some time.  Setting it with a powder takes care of the &quot;tacky&quot; issues but can  make the foundation look cakey so use a light hand.  <br /><br />Overall, good value for money.  Just make sure to get the right color/undertone and find an application process that works for you."

I have acne-prone skin and it hasn't caused more breakouts . It doesn't cover all of the acne, but it is less noticeable. Also, since I do have an oilier face, it does mattify the shine for some of the day, but not all. Although it is still hot here, so it's holding up well considering how warm it has been. My only issues are that it doesn't cover all my imperfections and there are parabens in the ingredients. But like I said, for the price and many choices on color, it's a good buy."

I decided to switch back to Revlon and boy do I miss this foundation! I went to play tennis and it was still on after practice. It covers my acne scars and blends great.

I was trying to break away from bare minerals because I really wanted to find something that would last ALL day especially when I get up for classes at 6am and dont get home until after 3. I literally do not have to reapply this one single time throughout an entire day...through classes, work, or just hanging out. it covers my scarring wonderfully, I barely use ANY concealer. another thing I was shocked by was how lightweight it feels after it dries...like nothing at all. and it keeps my extremely oily T zone 100% matte the entire day (bare minerals would leave me an oil slick). another awesome thing is how it doesnt settle into any lines...anywhere! I dont know what else to say, I'm just so amazed that a drug store product could be better than any high end stuff Ive tried...AMAZED, thats it.<br />PS I apply with my fingers for best results. foundation starts looking best after it settles down and completely dries, which does not take long :D"

I will be buying another bottle of this once my current one runs out. The price is great too! My ONLY complaint is the bottle is not user friendly."

My skin is a little darker, I have golden brown skin so it's very hard for me to find brands that match well. I've used Clinique, Mac, Make Up Forever, and now finally Revlon. In terms of coverage I would say this foundation is comparable to Clinique. The coverage is just enough to give you an even complexion without feeling caked on like Mac and Make Up Forever. <br /><br />It also stays on well throughout the day, which is a plus because I hate layering my make up. For those who said it didn't stay on, or was too thick - I think it might have been misapplied I use a foundation brush to apply, and I use very little. I actually use a q-tip to get the right amount on my face, that's how little I need.<br /><br />Now that I've foud a cheap alternative to the expensive brands, I'm never going back."

It lasts all day, once it's on it won't go anywhere until I take it off. It definitely helps with oil. I have mild acne and some scarring, and this covers it without concealer. I *might* need to use concealer if I have a really bad pimple, but most days, this is fine alone. The one thing though - it dries extremely fast, so you have to work in very small sections and blend it quickly. If you try to apply all over your face all at once, you will not be able to blend it at all. I love this, I'm going to keep buying it."

Which meant a lot considering he's a &quot;man's man&quot; and doesn't notice these things. <br />I also live in the California desert, were lately it's reached 118 and the heat doesn't phase my foundatoin (I don't wear primer).

Out of all the drugstore brands, it is my favorite. It does not really last 16 or 24 hours. But, it has good full coverage, and goes on smooth. I have acne scars and this does a good job of covering. Is it as nice as some of the brands, like HD Forever or Tarte? No, but it's pretty close. And for the price, it's worth it, until I find a brand name that will last longer. That is the biggest flaw of this makeup. I feel like I go through it quickly."

I am in my late 30's and hate the sheer make-up (why bother?) This is the first foundation that has covered my skin evenly and has enough warth in the color that I look like I have glowing skin. The only 'issue' is if you want to touch up or reapply it can almost 'build' color on top of what you have so you have to be careful with that, but for the price the best inexpensive foundation around. I bought the one for oily/combination skin although my skin is dry and it seems to work better than any of the one's for &quot;dry&quot; skin.? Hmmm worth a try."

I noticed less oil on my chin and forehead and if I am going out later in the evening I notice all I need is to conceal under my eyes and  a bit around my mouth.<br /><br />It does add a bit of shine depending on how much you put on your skin but some translucent powder helps that in the morning.  <br /><br />It is smooth, does not clog my pores and fills in my acne scarring very well.<br /><br />I look forward to trying other Colorstay products!"

After a 8 hour shift at work, I'll use a make up removing wipe and there will still be a good amount on my face. The only think I dislike is the smell. To me, it smells like roses and I hate the smell of any flower. If it was non-scented then I'd give it the 5 stars."

And my skin isn't dreamy- I'm a teenager, with skin that is the definition of &quot;combination&quot;.

I've used it a couple of days, and I love how easy it is to apply.  It's not heavy, but it hides my blemishes well.  I didn't get shiny, even after 8 hours of wearing it.

I used to use the Neutrogena Healthy Skin foundations and the Almay skin Clearing one, but when I switched to this product my skin started clearing up right away! I love this product :)"

You can get light to full coverage. Because of this I can do double duty and apply it lightly with a sponge as foundation and then use the sponge tip to apply it to blemishes as a concealer. It keeps my EXTREMELY oily skin looking matte all day and it DOES NOT BUDGE. I go to a lot of concerts where I'm dancing and sweating for hours but if I wear this my face will still look completely fresh by the end of the night. I can also rub my face, get caught in the rain, or make out with my boyfriend (haha) and this stuff sticks to my face like glue. My only warning is that you want to apply this kind of quickly because it tends to dry fast."

But, I wasn't 100% happy with the covergirl and clinique is hard to get ahold of in Stillwater Oklahoma. I saw that Revlon was a highly purchased foundation and decided to give it a go. The coverage is really buildable so you can apply a lot to problem areas and leave others a little lighter. It covers fairly well, my acne scars are significantly less noticeable. I use smashbox primer under this foundation and it lasts for hours. I normally get greasy on my nose, but it's significantly less with this foundation."

A LOT. Its thick enough for good coverage but on the same beat it causes REALLY bad breakouts. I have super sensitive skin, and this makeup worked fine on it- no irritation that is.

It's light so I don't feel it throughout the day. And it's difficult to mess it up if you need to touch your face for some reason.<br /><br />I will say, I have really oily skin. Using this foundation by itself will appear greasy just an hour after applying it. Using it with bareMinerals Oil Control primer keeps the shine down longer but I still find myself using oil absorbing sheets after about four hours, otherwise it would get a higher rating from me."

A friend suggested Revlon. I was hesitant but what the heck. The Ulta sales associate was very helpful in finding a color that would match me. I am fair/light but its somewhat difficult to find a matching color due to my skin tones. The &quot;Nude&quot; is a perfect match. I must say, I was surprised with the coverage. I definitely found a money saver. One tip to share... I found its much easier to apply with a foundation brush. Although I do use the sponge around nose to blend evenly what the brush misses."

However, I looked in natural light and my face was purely orange. My neck and body were their normal ghostly pale, but my neck looked like I used an entire bottle of bronzer. Every flaw on my face was emphasized. Best for darker skin tones so if you're Irish like me, skip all Revlon products unless you like having the most noticeable makeup line EVER."

I also use Revlon's Primer along with this product, and the combination virtually eliminates the appearance of my pores and acne, even some of my acne scars. <br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone looking for more coverage in a foundation, as it is very thick. It also dries rather quickly once applied to the face, so blend it in quickly to prevent streaks. This is definitely a go-to product for me; give it a try if it sounds like what you're looking for!"

You can also mix this with a cheaper, low coverage foundation if you find that it's too thick for you."

I have acne scars which needed to be covered and this did a fantasic job! Many people have said this dries too quickly but I need to work fast in the morning anyway so this was not a problem for me. I use a brush and i REALLy recommed using a good primer under this. Sadly, this broke me out a little and has an odor (similar to that of tempra paint). I dont know if it was the concealer that I wore that day or what but at the end of my day I noticed orange patches on my skin... im going to give it another try though. it totally lives up to its name of &quot;colorstay&quot;."

I've used some pretty spendy foundations (Born This Way, Naked Skin, Bare Minerals) and I feel that this foundation does just as good of a job as any of those, plus it saves me like 30 bucks. Haha. I have combination skin, but definitely tend to get oily throughout the day. This foundation doesn't slip and slide throughout the day, but may need a little powder if you like a super matte face. Either way, it covers my dark circles, acne and scars without looking too cakey! I almost never wear concealer with this foundation simply because I don't feel that I need it! Definitely give it a try if you haven't already!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","cassie","Houston, Texas",4,"I don't know if I'm the only one saying this but FINALLY a drugstore foundation line that doesn't have primarily pink undertones in them!! I can't tell you how many times I bought a foundation that looked like it matched me through the bottle, went home and tried it on and was thoroughly disappointed by how pink the foundation came off on my skin. I typically am the second lightest shade in any line of foundation I try as I am with this one, I'm shade 150 buff. This matched me as soon as I started blending it on my face, with no annoying pinkness. This line is definitely made for us girls with cool undertones! I got it in the oily/combo version but let me tell you a few problems I had with it, it doesn't finish matte. Nor will it control your oilyness on it's own without at least adding a matte finishing powder like I had to. The oily/combo version finishes dewy and a bit sticky which I didn't like but as I said, as soon as I applied the matte finish powder it looked perfect! The only reason I didn't throw this stuff away after the annoying finish was because it's the only drugstore foundation that matches me perfectly! Also another thing is that it is quite hard to wash off. Usually I'm able to wash off all of my makeup with a scrubbing face wash and see nothing left on my face. But with this foundation because it is quite heavy and so full coverage I had to wipe off quite a bit of excess with a makeup remover wipe after my shower. I digress though, it is worth the money if you're looking for an amazing line, with tons of beautiful shades, that lasts all day and a nice handy bottle pump!"

I have a cool undertone and medium skin. There were not enough medium shades. And the ones that were available looked too similar too each other. Nevertheless, I picked out the shade that looked closest to my skin tone. The next darkest shade looked the same as the one I bought, and the darker one after that was too dark. When I got home and tried it out, it was way too light for me. I also lost the receipt and can't return it. However, I am giving it 3 stars because it applies well, has medium coverage, doesn't look streaky or cakey, and is what I would expect from a foundation for this price. Will work out for you if you can find your shade."

I have veryy oily skin, so when it gets hot, I expect to look in the mirror and see a cakey oily mess. I never had that problem with this foundation. <br />The first day I tried it I ended up going to the gym with it on. Through all the sweat and face-wiping, I got home and it still looked good! I also didn't break out from it (I'm super oily and acne prone). The next day I wore it wasn't a very eventful day, it lasted from the time I applied it up until I removed it and I didn't have to blot at all.<br />Now, for the ultimate test. I went looking for Pok&#65533;mon for a few hours. It was HOT and humid in Michigan (100 degrees that day if I remember correctly). I was so hot and sweaty and constantly wiping my face. I got home and cooled off later, then I looked in the mirror and noticed it BARELY caked around the edges of my nose. I'm super super impressed with this foundation. I expected to return it but I'm definitely keeping :) <br /><br />I have a lot of acne scarring as well as some active breakouts on my face. I was able to get a full matte coverage using a flat &amp; dense kabuki brush (sigma f80). I apply some dots of the foundation all over my face and then dab it in with the brush. I don't do a lot of &quot;buffing&quot; bc that moves the product around too much. <br />Highly recommend this foundation :) only downside is the shade selection can be tricky"

I use Two Faced sensitive skin primer first and then apply a lite coat on my face in a circular motion with a foundation brush. I use a lighter shade and it has a medium matte type finish. Through out the day if it's warm the foundation starts to look more dewy, not oily. Liquid foundation always makes me break out, but this product does not. It can be a pain remove. To remove I massage extra virgin olive oil all over my face, no the EVOO doesn't break me out either, and it breaks up any makeup I have on. I wipe off the oil and makeup with a baby wipe, and then I am ready to wash my face. Great product for a great price."

When buying a full coverage foundation, I hope that it can really FULLY COVER. I found that it was not buildable and having to use quite a bit of concealer over acne and scars. <br />I also found how truly necessary it was to use a primer with this foundation. While I normally use a primer anyway, I wanted to see how this foundation held up on its own. It did not. Only after a few hours of wear the foundation had already began to separate from my face. My pores looked huge. <br />Bottom Line: I think this foundation would be good for someone without acne or bumps on their face, as it blended and evened skin tone just fine.

I really have super oily skin and I work 10 hr shifts and this lasts all day without showing shine. Of course a natural shine will always pop through and I do not touch up but it doesn't look gross or greasy and I am in love! It's very thick and has wonderful coverage. I'm so glad I was able to find such a wonderful foundation for such a good price :-) I use a Neutrogena primer and set it with Rimmel's Stay Matte but really the foundation is they key!"

When you use self tanner there is a warmth to the skin and it's hard to find complimentary foundation. Golden Caramel is PERFECT for my medium tanned skin tone. I just wish the Wichita locations would keep it in stock!!!"

I have very fair skin with freckles and a little rosacea.  This foundation in Ivory covers well (my freckles show through a little but that's OK), matches my skintone perfectly and lasts all day with no touch-ups except for occasional powder on my nose.  Also, my skin tends to be sensitive, and this foundation caused no breakouts at all.  I am very happy I decided to give it a try."

Tried it for a couple days and loved how it wore! It lasts forever and keeps you from looking oily all day but after 3 days I was already noticing that my skin was breaking out.  If you have sensitive skin, this is not the foundation for you."

This foundation is easy to blend even though it is quite thick, it sets beautifully with powder. Otherwise it stays just as well though I do recommend setting it with powder during these hot summer days. I have oily and acneprone skin and this product has never caused me breakouts and does keep my face flawless throughout the day. Sometimes I don't really even need concealer!"

Then I go over it with a damp beauty blender (bc my RT brush leaves all my foundations a little streaky.) Then I use the colorstay powder and a foam round and press it on top. It gives me all day medium coverage. I do get a little shiny in my t zone after about 8 hrs of wear at work (vigorous, stressful work) if I get a chance to go to the bathroom I can just fan my t zone with to and the shiny is gone."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Nichelle","Memphis, TN",4,"I was amazed at the coverage this product came with considering it is a drugstore brand. It actually covered so well that I was able to skip the concealer application,which in my book is a two thumbs up. The price is very affordable for most women on a budget &amp; it stays matte(the oily &amp; combination) pretty much all day. The color selection was a little off for me but I was able to combine two colors and found my perfect hue. Overall, it's a great product but I would have given 5 stars if the bottle had a pump mechanism much like their competitors."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","jess","florida",2,"I'm only giving 2 stars because I really enjoyed my first bottle of this foundation. At the time, I was pregnant and having issues with my skin that I wanted to cover up. After seeing such great reviews of this foundation I decided to give it a try. I LOVED it. It covered everything and lasted all day. After I was out, I decided to repurchase. IDK if I got a bad bottle or what, but it was HORRIBLE. Almost as if not the same formula. Needless to say, I threw it out and bought a new bottle hoping for the original that I had loved in the past. NO, just no :( This foundation is SUPER streaky on me and feels really heavy. I have tried numerous primers, moisturizers and application techniques. I cant get it to apply evenly on my nose and it just accentuates my pores. Keep in mind I used an entire bottle of this stuff and never has these problems. Sadly, I will not be repurchasing."

You can put on one layer with a damp beauty sponge for really natural looking coverage or build it for coverage so good you may not even need a concealer for spots! Doesn't budge on my oily skin all day long or rub off on stuff. I bought a lighter color to use as a concealer (under eyes &amp; on breakouts) &amp; it works perfectly! I'd never used matte finish foundations before this, but it looks so good without being cakey or powdery. I use a shimmery bronzer to still get the glowy look I like but my nose &amp; forehead aren't like an oil slick. I used to have a problem with foundation settling into lines on my face even with a primer but I don't even need a primer for this stuff. If I use it on my eyelids I don't even need a shadow primer either! Seriously amazing. I've made so many of my friends go buy this foundation bc it beats every kind I've tried, even expensive brands."

I used to work at MAC and lived off of their Studio Fix Fluid Foundation. After leaving the company, i wanted a comparable product at a lower price point, while delivering the coverage and all day wear i was accustomed to. i tried tons and tons of OTC (over the counter) foundations and this is by far, the best for full coverage and all day wear. Also, great color selection from warm to cool tones. this is a thicker/heavier foundation, so if you are looking for light/sheer/natural, i wouldn't recommend this. however, if you are looking for full coverage/flawless skin/budget friendly, i would recommend this over any other OTC product out now. the colorstay powders are great as well! doesnt leave a cakey look, but still provides a little bit of coverage."

I bought it thinking i was going to return it after trying it, but in fact, the color blended PERFECTLY with my skin tone.

I am very pale yellow and its hard to find a color that works without being too pink. This line in Buff worked great for me. You need to apply it fast and in sections because it does dry quickly. It lasts all day and may only need a powder touch up at the end of the day. The the only thing that sucks is trying to take it off! I use a cleanser with a makeup remover in it and a facial brush. I have to wash my face twice for it to come off and it does not come off of my foundation brush unless I use dawn to clean it."

I can apply it with my finger, beauty blender, foundation brush.. And it always go on perfectly.<br /><br />Also, it lasts a looong time.

I have normal/oily skin, esp in my t-zone, and this, come summer or winter, keeps it practically matte from 7a.m.-9p.m. I may touch up once if I'm going out at night, but other than that, this is THE staple in my immense collection of makeup, which, for reference, is mostly brand name."

I have oily skin and need my foundation to stay put thru the school day.  It seemed like every time I found &quot;the one&quot;, the brand would &quot;reinvent&quot; the formula or discontinue the color.  I've tried Laura Mercier (lack of colors), Bobbi Brown (broke me out), Lanc&ocirc;me (changed formula and color) and most recently I've been wearing Estee Lauder's Double Wear light (I did wear just the Double Wear but they also changed the formula and color). The Double Wear light has been great and it does last all day but at $39 for 1 oz, it is rather pricey.  I've used it for the last 2 years and now my daughter is using it as well so my cost is double. I started searching and reading reviews and everytime, this foundation, REVLON'S COLORSTAY kept coming up with AMAZING reviews.  I decided to try it and the first time was a winner. The color was PERFECT and it lasted from 6 a.m. until I took it off.  I can get it on here with the BUY ONE get ONE half off and then use the $3.50 off, who can beat it???  My teenage daughter and I are both using it now and my foundation costs have diminished considerably!!  I am thrilled to say the least!  REVLON has been around for years and years!  It may be an oldie and it certainly is a GOODIE!!! I really can't say enough good things about this foundation.  If you don't like it, you can always take it back!!  It is DEFINITELY worth trying!!"

This worked wonders and it saved me so much $$$ ! This lasts the longest too without needing to reapply. The only problem is it's very difficult to get off with just make up toilettes and one wash.

I used to use Maybelline's 24 hour stay makeup but I felt like i had to blot my face every hour. i finally got off that and went to something more expensive, Kat Von D's tattoo lock it foundation. It was a matte finish and very gorgeous, but, within a few hours, i had to blot my face again. I did my research and came across this one. It works so fantastic! I have yet to blot my face to get rid of excess oil. It lasts ALL day. I'm never having to touch up. I highly recommend this product for anyone with oily skin. Also, it is pretty great at matching skin tones. My face is fairly white. and it took me a try or two to finally get the perfect shade, but ulta lets you exchange if the color doesnt work, which is a huge plus."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Jac","NY",3,"I have heard so many good things about this product and as a person with very oily skin and very fair tone I was rather hopeful when I picked this product up. I never buy the same liquid drugstore foundation twice because I'm never happy with it, and I was really hoping this would change. I bought it in the lightest shade which seemed to match my skin quite well when I first applied it... until about five minutes later after it had oxidized about three or four shades darker. I managed to use powder to make it look somewhat believable, and hoped it would last the day. Unfortunately, the makeup nearly completely wore off on and around my nose which tends to be the oiliest part of my face at the end of the work day (about 7 hours). I'll continue to use this product until I'm done with it, but my high hopes have been a bit deflated. On the bright side it does have very buildable coverage, and stayed very well on the rest of my face with a nice matte finish."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Revlon Convert!","Colorado",4,"I have VERY sensitive skin and have dealt with having (mild) acne since I was in middle school (now 20). Because of this, I have to be careful what kind of makeup I try because many things tend to break me out. There has only been two foundation products that I've LOVED that have not done this: Mary Kay foundation and Urban Decay's Naked Skin (which I've most recently been using).<br /><br />I swore I had found the one when I switched to using Urban Decay's foundation. I was a woman obsessed. It didn't break me out, it lasted most of the day, it was easy to apply... but it costed me a good amount of money. My Naked Skin had began to run out and I was panicked because I wasn't sure that I'd be able to afford a new bottle. What was I going to do!?!<br /><br />Lucky for me, I remembered a little foundation gem that I'd heard about from youtube beauty gurus. I'd see the name here and there in different tutorials, with some gurus deciding to wear the Revlon Colorstay for the day. However, I was sold when I found one woman who literally wore it every single day. Most everything else she used was name brand, but not her foundation.<br /><br />I thought it was worth giving a shot, and I'm SO GLAD that I did! I like this foundation just as much if not better than my Naked Skin. It lasts me ALL day (maybe even looks better at the end of the day than Urban Decay) and gives me such a flawless look without looking too matte or satiny as many foundations do that are formulated for combo/oily skin. And you can't beat the price. Revlon has done such a good thing with this product. I pray they never discontinue it! Heck, I might have to buy myself 8 bottles or so... just to be safe...<br /><br />Anywho, the only problems I had with this foundation were that it is difficult to get out of the bottle. I had to beat the bottle onto the back of my hand to get the product out, as the product is quite thick. It'd be great with a pump. The second is that it is a little heavier feeling than my Naked Skin, but it's totally bearable. Additionally, I wish it had a little bit more SPF in it. However, I get a good amount of that in my moisturizer so that's not a huge deal. But you can never be too safe from the suns rays!<br /><br />Note*** This is only my second full day of wearing the foundation, I was just too excited about it. I had to share!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Drew","Wisconsin",3,"I am in such a love/hate relationship with this foundation. On one hand, it's not pricey compared to other high-end brands. A little goes a long way, so the 1 oz. bottle lasts awhile. The coverage is great, however, it doesn't last as well as I want it to. I was optimisitic when I saw they had two types: one foundation for oily skin, and one for dry/normal skin. Having incredibly oily skin, I obviously chose the one for oily skin. Even so, the foundation (even after I set it with powder), settles into fine lines I didn't even know I had, and gets splotchy halfway through the day. The coverage is unbeatable..I just wish it would last on my skin."

I have spent so much on all sorts of brands (Urban Decay, Makeup Forever, Dior, Smashbox, Clinique, etc.) and go figure, Revlon to the rescue. <br /><br />This foundation is super smooth and blends in easily. I do have more oily skin, especially on my nose and chin. It does not feel heavy or thick. So far, it's been awesome. I have mixed it with Smashbox's Artificial Light and it looks quite nice.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because I just started using it. I don't know if it's going to make me break out or anything yet. Also, it doesn't have a pump which is kind of disappointing, but I guess that's low on the list of priorities."

Other drugstore foundations are too oily, have bad coverage, make me break out, or dont match my skin tone. Though this foundation doesnt completely match my yellow skin tone, its the closest thing i've come to. I can look past it since it has a full coverage that i like but still manages to look natural. It does feel a little heavy compares to others and has a &quot;make up-ey&quot; smell but these things wouldn't keep me from buying!"

I feel like I've tried everything at Ulta.  I figured if the brand name expensive side does not have any foundations that works for my skin, maybe the other side of over the counter foundation works.  I just walked in the first isle and say this foundation.  I have combination skin.  Very oily in the summer and in the winter I get dry patches.  By far this foundation is the best for me because its cheap, it gives me nice, natural coverage (have a little redness on my cheeks), blends well and above all controls my oil and gives me a matte look.  I don't like super matte looks, so all I do is add some highlight to my cheeks and the tip of my nose and WALLLAAAA!  I am so happy with this product.  Thank you Revlon Color Stay!"

This is the only drugstore liquid foundation I have tried which actually does what it says it will do for my combo/oil skin, without making it look dry or thick. I get the full coverage I want, the natural looking pigmentation, the ease of application, and it doesn't irritate my skin.<br />I don't recommend wearing it over breakouts because while it doesn't make it worse, it almost feels like it hinders the area from naturally healing itself, most likely because it is being clogged.<br />This foundation works great for me during every season except summer, I just need something more like the Rimmel matte liquid foundation formula because my oil combined with sweat from the heat, will be enough to break down most foundations."

I also have seen this show (which I forgot the name of it) in which they did a full hour of comparing low end make up, middle priced make up and high end make up. For the face make up (foundation, I initially thought. But I think powder is also a part of it), the high end definitely won with no comparison. Everything else, you can buy the cheapest or middle priced, that is just up to you. I have age spots on my cheeks and initially I used BB creams. This was before I ever really used any foundation. That really didn't work for me. I bought prescriptives flawless foundation, which I don't remember why but it wasn't for me either. I have an oily tzone and combination skin for the rest of my face. With this, I tried with a primer and middle priced loose powder and it stayed probably 4-6 hours. You really get what you pay for. The primer I used is high end, so it should've stayed. I do like how it is full coverage, but it doesn't feel horrible when you have it on. I've used the L'oreal foundation and that felt like I needed to scratch my whole face. With this, you have to pair it with a really good powder after. I used Physicians formula youth pressed powder and OMG my face looked terrible. I never saw my face look the way it did with that powder. If you don't use a primer with this and you have noticeable pores, in a few hours, it would seep into your pores and make your pores really large. This is good for people who are slithly oily, VERY slight. With small to unnoticeable pores."

I have cystic acne, eczema, and natural redness in my cheeks. My skin is not dry (except for eczema patches) and is not oily. <br /><br />I liked the look of it, as I put it on, and it felt similar to the whipped. The coverage was good, but I felt like I had to add a second layer to get the same coverage as whipped (full). An hour after having it on, most of my make up was off. I was so embarrassed because I was at work, and had no way to take it all off. It may have been just with my skin, so try it for yourself. <br /><br />It was blotchy, didn't stay on, and left my skin looking oily. <br /><br />Will I repurchase? Never. Do I recommend? I think I would recommend to someone with few imperfections, and someone willing to retouch multiple times. <br /><br />It is not comparable to how great the whipped version is. In my experience anyways (: <br /><br />// I used alone, once (experience explained above).

I also found it to be a bit cakey on my dry to combination skin (although I will admit I bought the oily skin kind because I was wanting it to last around my t zone). As a whole it's an okay foundation, but the revlon colorstay whipped is so much better (creaminess, coverage, lightness, blendability) and just barely more expensive.

I am absolutely loving this foundation for several reasons. One, I finally got a proper shade match. I am Asian,olive complected, and between a light and medium. (About NC25).  Sand beige is a perfect match- it has a good beige undertone. (Not too pink or too yellow). Secondly,  I love that this foundation has increased its sun protection factor, but has switched over to mineral sunscreens (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide). Lastly the application is very much the same or improved: good pigmentation, buildable with a nice thin, consistency and a matte finish. It also wears nicely: it doesn't break down or get too oily, although my own oils do peek through by the end of the day. Though, that happens to me with all foundations.  At this price point, you cannot beat this foundation for oily/combo skins."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Aussiegirl","cali",5,"I've used Revlon Colorstay foundation for the past 10+ years and it is still my favorite foundation. I have very oily, sensitive breakout prone skin and it provides enough coverage to cover any scars or dark spots I have without looking heavy or greasy. I work 10hr workdays so I have to have makeup that will last and not melt off my oily skin and colorstay is the only liquid foundation I've found that does just that. It dries fast and is a full coverage foundation so you have to apply it quickly and blend or it can make you look like you're wearing a mask. I use a primer before I apply colorstay and set it with a translucent powder to give it double security."

It melted off my face after two hours (with primer) and became cakey. A total mess on my face, and cheaper foundations have held up better on my oily skin. I had to return it."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","5280 Girl","Denver, Co.",4,"This is my frequently used foundation. For the price- it is an excellent buy. It blends well, covers well, doesn't smell, and stays put for several hours. I have very oily skin so I recommend using an oil control moisturizer, mattifyer for the oil, or wear a light powder because I do shine through after a few hours. I love that this makeup doesn't come off as easily as most, when it does- it WILL come out, so that is nice that it doesn't ruin your clothes. It has build able coverage but should be used FOR FULL COVERAGE gals only! This is not meant for tinted moisturizers or foundation newbies. If you have scars or serious blemishes- this is the stuff you want. Just be careful to close the bottle completely because it WILL leak. To me it has no scent, the color is a great match, and I discontinued using my Clinique ($32 foundation) for this one. Definitely recommend."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Barbie","Miami, Florida",4,"I have to admit, ever since I was recommended this product by a fellow make-up artist and make-up review blogger friend of mine, I haven't looked back. For years I have used MAC Foundations, always thinking it was the best in the industry, BUT, I always noticed my skin was always shiny when using it. Since I had used it for years, I figured it was suppose to be that way and just got use to it. Then as the years went by and I got better and better with make-up application and then decided to go to school for make-up classes, I realized everything I was doing wrong and learned new tricks and can not complain.  Since I was just starting as a make-up and needed to bargain shop, but yet have a wide variety for the different types of faces, colors, etc...I asked around, did online research, etc...a friend who is a beauty reviewer and bloggers for different companies, recommended this foundation to me. I still wasn't considering it for myself, but more for clientele. So I didn't even try the product first and just ordered the entire line, when a sale went up on it. So once I received the merchandise, I then decided to use it on myself and see how it looks.  What can I say? Everyone complimented that night on how awesome my make-up looked and how great my skin looked. I thought maybe it was a fluke night, so I just continued to use it. I have to admit, I do not get shiny anymore, the make-up lasts all night long and I have even slept with it on, which I know I am not suppose to, and the next day it is still on my face. Ever since I purchased this product I have not used any other product on myself and I use this on my clientele and everyone loves the coverage and how nice their skin looks. I recommend it to everyone! It's affordable and looks great. I don't know how it would look on someone with VERY greasy skin, but I have used on combination skins and dry skins and no one complains about it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","r12345","Pittsburgh, PA",1,"I've been using this foundation for many years.  It has great coverage and is the only foundation that lasts for more than a few hours on my oily skin.  This is the first time I've ordered it from ulta; unfortunately, one of the bottles had leaked foundation over the packaging.  In addition, the foundation in each bottle is much thicker than usual (I had to add water to even get it out of the bottle) and I suspect it has been sitting around for a while."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Sydney","Houston, TX",3,"I wanted to love this foundation, I really did. But I don't. It claims to be formulated for combo/oily skin (which I have) and while the shade I bought was and EXACT match for my natural skin color, it just isn't up to par. First off the smell. I am very, very particular when it comes to scented items, as I am prone to headaches, and this foundation has a pretty particular, very noticeable scent that doesn't diffuse for a good half an hour. My other complaint is that no matter how much I exfoliate and moisturize and then apply this foundation, it cakes. It doesn't always cake immediately, but it does cake and clings to any semblance of dry skin it can find. I was really hoping to find a combo skin foundation solution, but it looks like I will be back on the market soon."

I will be buying this again"

For those who have issues with caking-use a damp sponge or beauty blender. It made a world of difference for me. I use this foundation for my super long work and school days.

It's medium coverage and I prefer a bit of a fuller coverage but I just dust a little powder over it and I'm good to go.  I really like this stuff. Pretty good at keeping my oil at bay, goes on smooth, dries quickly, doesn't break me out and lasts all day.  If I had one negative comment it would be the packaging. I really wish there was a pump. Other than that, this is a keeper for me."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","JAG","Montana",1,"Not many good things about this except it did last all day after a fairly heavy application - and no oiliness on my t-zone. It did cause breakouts, and I could not find a color to match my olive skin tone. Also, it did tend to feel heavy and thick on my skin all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Cactus Cat","Phoenix, AZ",4,"I use this in Early Tan, which is an excellent shade match for me. This foundation has excellent, yet natural-looking coverage, and it definitely lasts until I wash my face at night. I need an occasional powder touch-up on my nose, but that's mostly because of my allergies. My only complaint about this foundation is actually a pretty big problem for me: I can't find a sunscreen that works with it. Having oily skin, the need to wear sunscreen every day is a pain. Of course, I'd rather have greasy skin than wrinkles, spots, or disease, so I wear sunscreen. So far, Clinique City Block has given me the best results with this foundation, but, sadly, this foundation is SO much better over bare skin. ColorStay doesn't add any special &quot;glow&quot; or texture or anything like that, but for a low-priced foundation it could be great for daily wear. I find this to be WAY more mattifying than Clinique Stay Matte, and it costs less than half the price."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Bree","Flower Mound, TX",5,"This is the only foundation that does not break me out. It just happens to also be the least expensive one I've tried."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Su-mi","Tulsa, OK",5,"I have combination sensitive skin with moderate Rosacea (redness).  Colorstay works great for me.  It does not irritate my skin &amp; I don't feel like I'm wearing anything on my face at all. It does not exacerbate the Rosacea and it doesn't cause me to breakout (if a product causes you to breakout, give it a week or so to see if the breakouts stop.  Sometimes if a new product is introduced to facial skin the skin may have a temporary reaction to it which will disappear over time). Over the years I've tried numerous brands of foundation with disappointing results and I'm surprised that an inexpensive brand is the best match for me.  This makeup is really THAT GOOD. I did, however, have a difficult time finding a shade that matched my skin.  I tried Nude and Buff but they have too much yellow.  Ivory is too pale.  I mixed Ivory &amp; Nude at a 60/40 ratio and it's a dead on match for my skin shade.  I mix both shades together on the back of my hand and apply with my index finger.  Professional makeup artists recommend using a brush or sponge to apply foundation but these don't work with my skin.  I find I have more control over the product and use less of it by using my finger.  I also don't use powder to &quot;set&quot; my makeup because all the powders I have tried over the years settle in my large pores creating the appearance of little white flecks.  With powders I also experience dryness, flaking and peeling, even the talc free ones. I cleanse, tone, moisturize,  exfoliate using Missha's Brown Sugar Scrub and a Missha mask once a week. I'm doing everything that works for my skin. (Everyone's skin is different. If you find a product or application doesn't work for your skin it's not a failing on your part.  You just have to keep experimenting until you find what works for your individual skin.  That can be a costly hassle but it's part of being a woman who wears makeup.  Thankfully, stores accept returns!)  If my skin gets shiny in the T-zone during the day I'll apply a little dusting of powder to the oily areas only.  After trial and error I've found that the Colorstay combo/oily foundation works well for me in hot &amp; humid weather.  I have to switch to normal/dry in the Fall and Winter or my face becomes too dry and tight.  There are many positive reviews of Revlon's Colorstay and there's a reason for that.  This foundation is truly the best one out there.  I highly recommend Colorstay."

You can layer the coverage, though I generally find that even with minimal application, it still comes on quite heavy so only wear it if you want full coverage.

It blends nicely into the skin and lasts well throughout the day and does not get patchy if worn for a few hours. The coverage is good as well, depending on how you apply it.

I have pretty sensitive skin too, and usually have a reaction within the first couple of hours, and so far seems pretty okay. I have two fairly bad looking zits today, and I was able to cover them up easily. <br /><br />The foundation is velvety, it's smooth, and it doesn't really feel like I'm wearing much except my false eyelashes. I did use primer, finishing powder, bronzer, blush, highlighter, on top of this, but if you're only going to go with this product, it really feels like nothing is there. I've had much heavier feeling makeup than this, so it's extremely pleasant to be able to breathe. My pores look a little large up close, but that can be fixed with a pore minimizing primer.<br /><br />Tip: don't use a beauty blender, get yourself a brush (preferably something firm that you can stipple into your skin and then blend out- I use one from it cosmetics, but elf seems to have a really nice one for liquid foundations). It applied so much better with my brush, and it built more coverage as well. I think most of the people who say it's light coverage used their hands or a beauty blender in all honesty, because I have no need for concealer or color corrector. <br /><br />I'm still wearing this for a few more hours to see how it goes with my combination skin type where I get oily throughout the day, but for now I give kudos to revlon for changing their formula for this product."

I would surely recommend this to anyone and would buy this again!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Kat","Orlando, FL",5,"First let me start by saying that I never write reviews and that I usually frown on &quot;drugstore&quot; foundations. I tried this because my aesthetician suggested I switch to a non-pore clogging makeup regimen. I've been using MAC Pro Longwear for quite some time to cover up acne scars and I was unsure about switching. I read up on this product and it's supposed to be a good dupe, but I think this product is actually better than MAC's and you can't beat the price. <br /><br />I first tried it this weekend when it was humid and 88 degrees (I live in FL), I spent some time outside and I was running around doing errands. My foundation stayed in tact and matte with no touch-ups until I washed it off! I've never had that happen before! <br /><br />The coverage is also good if you're looking to cover up hyperpigmentation. I usually apply a cream concealer, foundation and then use a little more liquid concealer for touch ups and better coverage. I've been able to skip applying the second round of concealer since switching to this.<br /><br />The only con I can think of is that I have to mix 2 shades in order to get my correct color (I'm a lighter African American with gold undertones), but I was able to grab these on sale at buy one get one 50% off. That's 2 for $15!!! Revlon has made a believer out of me with this product I'm even thinking of trying the concealer next."

I have pink undertones and have found that I need a yellow foundation to cover it. So many foundations are too pink or oxidized and turn orange. This foundation has never oxidized on me. I use buff. Perfect for my skin. I always come back to it. Use a good cleanser because it doesn't come off easy. I use a clarisonic with purity made simple and I don't break out. Try it and you will love it"

It blends well, I can wear a powder over it to give that clean air brush look. <br /><br />The only thing I have a problem with is the bottle.

There has been a lot of talk of how this is comparable, so I compared...I think this product is a great alternative and the price is excellent! <br /><br />I recommended it to my sister..we have different skin tones / types (I am normal-oily, she is oily; I am a medium skin tone, she is light/ivory; I get breakouts once in a while, she has rosacea). She loves this as well, and we have never had a foundation that works well on both our skins, and breakouts are not an issue, and the color range works well for both of us.<br /><br />I've read some issues in regards to the scent..I personally like it - I am not a fan of &quot;perfumey-type&quot; foundations.<br /><br />Dries quickly, and coverage can be controlled to be light-to-full. No greasiness. I use it with loose powder to prevent heaviness."

With the formula change came color change. I recently ordered medium beige and compared to old bottle of medium beige, new one is so much pinker. So I would recommend checking the shade out in person rather than ordering same shade online.<br /><br />Still great staying power. I don't wear foundation past 16 hour so I don't really notice a difference in wear time. Goes on nicely especially with little bit of water. Finish to me is not completely matte which is good. New one oxidizes less. But then again, it has less yellow/orange to begin with so maybe that's why"

But while wearing this, I didn't see any oil after the day. And I did a lot of running around that day, but the foundation looked perfect. I am in love with it! Definitely going back to this one.

The makeup has a heavy feeling, but I love that it gives a full coverage and lasts all day. I have dark spots from previous breakouts and I currently am struggling with acne breakouts. Since I started using this product I have noticed that I have not been breaking out as much. I love that this product is noncomodegenic. My only complaint is that the bottle I purchased does not have a pump and that makes applying it messy sometimes. I usually apply this with my hands because I have found it difficult to really blend with the foundation brush I have. Other than that I would highly recommend this product."

I can't believe I finally found an affordable and so perfect for me foundation! I love this stuff, covers GREAT, easy to apply with a sponge. And I always set it with the MAC loose powder (Still haven't been able to find an affordable replacement for that one.) I find that with my skin, I definitely need a powder to set this stuff, but I get compliments on my skin ALL the time. I have a ton of hyperpigmentation and just plain uneven skin-tone, and whenever I use this makeup, people say I have perfect skin. Love Love Love it."

I have scars from blemishes that need covering up and this did an alright job. The coverage is good and reduces redness on its own, so if you have concealer for color correcting you'll find you'll need little to none paired with this product. In fact it covers so much color on your face that you'd have to wear blush to look alive and bring warmth back into your face.. The finish is matte and blends quite nicely. I use a foundation brush to apply and it gives me a fresh face. This does feel a tad heavy but can be easy to forget after wearing for a while, but I'd hate to get intimate with someone and have them feel this heavy grease-like foundation on while leaning in for a smooch on the cheek. The fact that it feel oily is strange because I don't have oily skin. I can happily say this hasn't broken me out despite it's tad heavy, greasy feel.<br /><br />If you're looking to just cover up redness, dark circles and scars, this is perfect. Leave the concealer behind and replace it with blush so you don't look sickly though. Good for its price."

I was amazed! For a drugstore brand it works really well, probably even better than name brand. Coverage is build-able and I'd say it is a medium coverage foundation. The only flaw is finding a shade. I'm not porcelain or fair but I would say I am light and I chose &quot;medium beige&quot; To me, the colors for this foundation run very light. I can't believe I finally found a foundation that works. This finish is beautiful too, it leaves a smooth, matte finish."

So I decided to try this stuff and I have super dry skin but I add Argon Oil as a moisturizer and it makes this foundation look amazing. You really need to work with a little at a time to get a great finish.

As a matter of fact I started wearing expensive foundation products because I was tired of taking back poorly matched drug store products - those color wheels never work!!!  Anyway, I like the product very much and no longer see the need to spend $40+ on foundation any longer. Its easy to apply with the Beauty Blender and blends well, providing as much coverage as you like.   I let my daughter use it and she went out and purchased her own she liked it so much.

I thought I had finally found the right one-- till I had the worst breakouts ever.<br /><br />Now I have combination and acne prone sensitifve skin, So it was great covarage for my acne and redness. Little did I know that the ingredients inside would give me the worst breakouts ever. It took me six months to realize that because I was already breaking out, but it only made it worse over time, my pimples were becoming bigger and splotchier(if thats even a word) and it left marks that I am still suffering for atm.<br /><br />So just be careful - find out if it is compatible with your skin type and if it works for you then thats great bc this product is awesome and at a good deal, it just didn't work for me :("

I have oily skin and would always need to touch up throughout the day. I also had a few blemishes. After using this foundation everyday for about two weeks, my face broke out like crazy! And yes, I did wash my face every night. Because of this, I stopped using this product. I tried using it two more times after waiting for my face to clear up  and after using it again, my face would break out again. If it weren't for the breakouts, this would have been the perfect foundation for me. Now I use the Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous, which works well for oily skin."

I have tried many products from high end to drugstore and ive had problems with coverage, breakouts etc... Ive always heard good things about this and i finally gave in and tried it and ive been hooked ever since. I apply this with a sponge because i prefer to dab the product on which works well for me. ive heard people say it dries fast but i havent had that problem because i apply this foundation one side at a time. If you want less coverage i would recommend lightly damping the sponge with water or something like fix + from mac. My biggest problem with this is the color selection, im yellow/olive toned and it was almost impossible finding my color, the darker colors like toast tend to turn orange on me but im currently using Natural Tan which works well once i blend it and add blush or bronzer. I havent tried using this alone. i always set it with Macs mineralize skinfinsh and omg its perfection!! Its also important to remove this properly! in my opinion its something to try! if u know how to apply this u will def get a great flawless look without paying crazy money for something more expensive!"

However after reading in multiple beauty blogs that the Revlon ColorStay is the best bargin brand foundation, I thought I'd give it a try. Overall for the price it was a good buy for me. I'm used to paying $35-$45 a bottle for foundation. The consistency is a little milky and I'm not crazy about the cheap smell, but the coverage is buildable and covers my blemishes well. It lasts throughout the day and wears well. The only big cons are 1. the cakey look it can give me if I don't blend it well with a brush and 2. the cheap packaging and bottle which causes you to go though the product quickly. Overall, I will buy again and use on days when I want to substitute and not use my high end foundations."

I tried it, and it worked fabulous. The coverage is full without being heavy, it lasts a VERY long time without having to touch up, and its a GREAT product for the price. The only cons I have about it, is the color selection isnt that great. If you leave the cap off for long periods of time, the makeup will turn a shade darker due to oxygenation (normal with any product but this one changes a full shade), and lastly the top...ALWAYS screw it tight. IF its even missing the tinniest milimeter of a turn, it WILL leak. ANd its awful when it does. It has happened to me at least 5 times in my coach purse :( Aside from those things, its a REALLY good product for the cost."

I have very fair, oily skin with some break outs here and there. It covers almost everything, but very red imperfectins will need a concealer. Make sure you apply it in small sections because it is difficult to blend once it begins drying. Once applied, it stays on all day and helps control the oil on my face."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Nicole","Bay City, MI",4,"For the price, this product is fantastic! It has a medium coverage and does well with my combination skin, though my nose area starts to become shiny within about 4 to 6 hours. I have acne scaring on my chin and a little bit on my cheeks, and this does very well to conceal my problem areas. Best of all, it doesn't break me out, like the majority of foundations. However, it doesn't come with a pump, like the PhotoReady does, which is extremely annoying because I can't get the right amount of product I want."

Colors matched my skin tone fairly well, but it doesn't cover my acne scarring very well at all. I build layers of it over those scarred areas, but it still somewhat pokes through. The oily skin formula does not help with oil control much, either, in my opinion."

My nose can get really oily and that's the place that my makeup starts to disappear first, but not with this foundation. My makeup will be in the exact same place where I applied it 12 hours before.

I have to say that I was able to exactly match my color by guessing (Lucky me).  It goes on well and has a nice finish to it.

I got the combination/oily shin one and I was greasy on my t-zone and chin after about 2 hours with it on (in an air conditioned office).  I reapplied powder throughout the day to stay matte.

I prefer it over my high end foundation, which range from $40 to $50. The coverage is full and there's no harsh scent, so it great for sensitive skin. Also, it doesn't cause any breakouts for me. I can wear this all day, even in super hot weather, and it will literally last the whole time. I only have to touch up with powder once, maybe twice. It does take a little long to dry on my opinion, so I wouldn't recommend countouring immediately after applying the foundation. You wouldn't know my skin is extremely oily while wearing this, I love it."

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because there are other products out there at this price point that are actually full coverage.  This one is more of a medium coverage foundation and that is not a bad thing at all. It lays nice on the skin and once it is dry, it gives a nice matte look to the skin without crease lines.  I did find that the best application method that works for me is with my bare clean hands.  I tried a beauty blender, a foundation brush and an Artis Brush, all of which gave the foundation a streaky look or swiped the product right off my face.  Using the tips of my fingers, I only needed one or two pumps and basically just applied it like a moisturizer all over and let it sit to dry.  Speaking of drying, I think this is a big step that most people fail to take and decide too soon that it is greasy or oily.  It is still a liquid foundation so give it a few minutes to settle and dry to see the actual color and texture.  I use this everyday and I have very naturally oily skin.  I have noticed that the foundation does seem to control the oil a bit more than usual.  Bonus, there is an SPF 15 in the product!  So many of us either forget or ignore applying SPF to our faces daily so this is an awesome feature for me.  There is a very wide selection of colors to choose from as well.  However, it would be nice if they could come out with some more cooler shades.  I currently use the shade True Beige and once it dries and settles, it blends well with my medium skin tone.  As far as rub off...of course it rubs off a little.  Honestly, they're aren't many foundations under $10 that don't have some sort of rub off throughout the day.  Overall, I am very happy I decided to give this foundation a try and recommend it to anyone with oily-medium skin looking for a light weight medium coverage foundation."

It lasts a good 12-15 hours on my skin and even though it might look a bit shiny by the end of the day, doesn't get oily in a gross way. It's not heavy, but offers my preferred amount of coverage with one pump. My only negative is that it's a touch too dark for me, even in the lightest shade (maybelline fit me matte in 110 is my perfect match). I've found that after trying both shades multiple times, on me, 110 and 150 are the same amount of pale but with pink (110) or yellow (150) undertones. I'm definitely more on the yellow side, so I just mix some of the Nyx white shade adjuster in until it's pale enough, and then I'm good to go! This will always be my favorite!"

I chose this foundation because it got great reviews and it was a bargain at $9-12 in local stores. <br /><br />I have really oily skin on almost my whole face - usually I can't wait to get home and cleanse to get the oil / makeup slick off! With this foundation (plus powder to set), I am matte all day long and only do a little blotting in the afternoon to draw off excess oil (which comes through my foundation instead of wiping it off). <br /><br />It has great coverage and takes care of my under-eye area without needing additional concealer. For trouble spots / breakouts, I am using the Color Stay concealer on top of the foundation (set with pressed powder). I have never felt so &quot;dry&quot; with a liquid foundation before. I'm so impressed!"

I was scared at first to wear something that I've heard is so full coverage because I am not used to covering up my natural skin too much, but I have to say that I really like what my face looks like wearing this. My main downside is that the smell is pretty strong and lasted for a while. I have the Revlon photoready BB cream (which smells like sunscreen) and honestly, I prefer that scent to the heavy perfume of this foundation."

I found a great color match. I have tried this foundation with a few primers and powders and every time my face becomes an uncomfortable oily mess within a few hours. I don't feel like my skin is THAT oily, but for some reason it feels super oily and looks shiny with this foundation, even after applying powder throughout the day and blotting. If I rub my finger across my forehead it will wipe right off. This would be a great medium coverage foundation for someone with normal, not oily skin.

It covers really well without caking (thank god) and without drawing attention to any of my fine lines. <br /><br />I use a flat kabuki brush and I get a great airbrush finish. The best part is that it really controls the oil in my T zone.

Revlon is the only moderately priced cosmetic line that is not too brown, pink, or orangey  on their full coverage foundation in their lightest shades!  Colorstays palest ivory color is very neutral and creamy....I would imagine it would alsobea suitable match for very pale Asian and Latina complexions that are sometimes difficult to match due to how very neutral the shade is!  Also, it really does stay put well, nsither rubbing off, fading, or migrating to sit in creases and open pores.....a simple dusting of powder at lunch or dinner if you tend to get shiny will keep this looking matte, perfect and fresh from breakfast through a long night out.  This ismy All Time Favorite Foundation!  Have used other Colorstay products, but this is my Favorite...followed very closely by liquid lip Top Tomato.....which is a very clasic matte 40's and 50's sort of red that will survive any meal or beverage, never smudges or feathers, and comes off easily with bentle cleanser, chapstick, baby oil, or your nightly facial lotion."

I have acne scars plus discoloration on my face from a skin condition that I have. This makeup is medium-to-full coverage and does a great job at evening out my complexion. I apply this product with a makeup sponge and set with a light powder. The result is an even matte finish that is what I imagine to be as close to airbrushed as you can get with a liquid foundation. When set with powder this foundation will last you all day and well into the night. The only con I can think of is that it might feel a bit heavy for someone who doesn't like to wear a lot of makeup. For me though, I am not bothered by the product wear."

The Caramel is the PERFECT shade for my skin, which is amazing, since I could never find the perfect shade. I was using Bare Minerals, but I don't like how the powder makes my skin look ashy and fuzzy. I was reluctant to switch to liquid because I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. This foundation goes on light, has amazing coverage, and best of all it isn't harsh on my skin! I haven't broken out in the week that I've been wearing it, if anything my skin is feeling and looking BETTER! I workout at the gym every morning at 5am, and I use this foundation before my workout, and I still don't break out, and it even lasts through the workout. A couple cons as to why I didn't give it a full rating is, it's a bit difficult to get the product out of the glass bottle. Also it doesn't last as long as the product claims. I mean it stays on, but I get oily in my Tzone after about 6yrs into wearing it. I usually just use a translucent powder to dust on and I'm good to go again. Aside from that, I am absolutely thrilled with the product, and will be using again! Oh and I use it over the Ulta Matte primer and use the Tarte translucent powder to set and that's it! No concealer needed! :-)"

I have blemishes, dark spots and some red patches on my face and when I use Revlon ColorStay makeup I don't even need to use concealer. It's very gentle around the eyes and eyelids too."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Makeupholic","Los Angeles, CA",5,"Here's the thing! I have dry, sensitive skin and I use a moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin that works very well but leaves my face a bit oily. But when I heard of this product and how it works well for dry skin, I immediately gained interest in it! Little did I know, I purchased the Colorstay Makeup for Combo/Oily Skin instead of Dry Skin but this was no problem.  Because of the shine my moisturizer gave me, this product perfectly balanced the condition of my skin and provides a smooth, flawless finish!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Kelsey","New York",5,"I love this foundation soooo much! I am in the shade 200/220 and I mix it with my MAC Studio Fix Fluid SPF 15 in the shade NC25 and together they give a flawless finish that lasts all day and covers up all of my acne and flaws! Also, I use the Smashbox primer and spray the elf setting spray on my brush and dab it on my face when I'm done which makes it last even longer! Love!! Will continue to buy. A must for someone who wants a good covering foundation but doesn't want to spend money on expensive sephora brands."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Jersey gal","New Jersey",5,"I was in desperate search of a foundation that was good for acne prone skin. I tried all the expensive brands and they all either broke me out and made me look tranny like a man. This foundation make me look beautiful and flawless!! My tip will be to use it with a good primer and to wash your face 2 or 3 times as it can be hard to come off. Not a problem for me tho just giving you guys a aheads up! Also use a flat foundation brush!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Si","Portland,OR",5,"I just love this foundation!<br />Before I bought it I heard it was really good from some people, and then that it wasn't so good from other people. I heard it kinda feels like a mask when it dries, but it doesn't to me. I couldn't even tell I was wearing it. It really does stay on too! It even stayed on during my whole workout!<br />I'm very happy with this product."

I love the coverage and love I dont need to touch it up at all during the day or night, it stays true to its word it really does stay, the con about that is that its so hard to get off that its causes me to breakout. Ill stick with PurMinerals"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-combooily-skin?productId=xlsImpprod1810157","Ari","Boston,Massachusetts",4,"This product is pretty good but maybe a little thick on skin.For best use i wouldnt reccormend using a flat foundation brush or fingertips a mac 187 as shown on youtube would be best in circular motions!The price is awesome!the coverage is great but maybe too thick if you put on too much (this foundation is thick enough to the point where A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!)But i tried once and got the wrong color i thought it was somewhat my skintone in the bottle but it was way too dark once i got it on my skin! Bottom line i would purchase again now that i know how it is best applied and how to use it to have a perfect flawless complexion!!!"

I have tried a lot of foundations even some expensive ones like mac and benefit. Ive even tried primers underneath the foundation to help for better coverage. None compare to this product, i love it! A definate must have for any girl's makeup collection!"

Use along with the colorstay finish powder and a mist of finish spray.  Very Matte and a full coverage. I put my foundation liquid into a pump bottle.. works great and gives me the right amount of liquid."
