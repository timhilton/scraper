Best coverage I ever had, so I bought another one for my purse. Covers my red, brown, and bruises beautifully. Inexpensive, too. Highly recommended."

I love buying this for a lot cheaper than brand name stick foundations! BUT! It is a little hard to blend so my suggestion AND THIS IS WEIRD but to take a lighter NOT TOO CLOSE and liquids it a little so it's not so dry and blend out with VERY DAMP BEAUTY BLENDER AND THEN IN CIRCULAR MOTIONS A FLUFFY BRUSH FOR THE BEST LOOK!"

It covers my dark circles completely, but it creases and looks cakey with powder on top. It's a good product for the price, just takes a little midday maintenance."

No messy make up sponges and no make up on my fingers. It goes on very smooth also. I can always find what I need in stock at Ulta. They always have my color. You can't beat the coupons and reward system either! I am very pleased with my makeup and the cost. I'll definitely come to Ulta when I run out."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","NinaTheWriter","New York",4,"So far I like this stick its easy to apply and I can blend it with my fingers. However, it feels kind of chalky when its been applied and the tint makes me look fairly orange. I know Im a difficulty skin town to match foundation to but this was the closest color they had for me. I can use this as everyday makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Ashlee","New Braunfels, TX",5,"I use this in the color Rich Ginger to contour my face (I'm fair/light skin tone). This product provides such a beautiful and natural looking contour and blends SO WELL. I just use the Real Techniques expert face brush to blend and I always get compliments on how natural and beautiful my contour is. <br /><br />I can't give a review about using this as a foundation, but if you're looking for a cream contour product I highly recommend trying this."

However, the day I bought it I had some good deals. I prefer stick foundation because it is easy and quick to apply. I do like it and will buy again."

I love the revlon whipped foundation but my skin just doesn't agree with it anymore so I had high hopes for this stick. Alas, it doesn't stay on very well, doesn't have very good coverage and settled pretty badly by the afternoon. Definitely wouldn't purchase again."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","maaya","Syracuse, NY",4,"I bought this because I wanted a convenient foundation to put on when I traveling. I have oily skin and so wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I would have given this a 5-star except that I can't testify how it holds up to oily skin in summer, since it's fall/winter now.<br /><br />The coverage is medium and buildable; I was happy that I could build coverage without it being cakey. It stayed matte during the day and didn't &quot;break&quot; on my nose, as most foundations do (though, again, it's fall/winter now). It blends well, even with fingers. The shade I got was an EXACT match, which is impressive (usually they're too yellow or too pink).<br /><br />The only downside is that it's small; 2/3 of the tube is the rotating part, not the part that actually encloses the stick. I mean... if only 1/3 of the tube is the actual product, then they could have made the rotating part shorter, or lowered the price!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","char","Michigan",4,"I'm so glad I found this. It's quick, natural feeling and natural looking. For those of you who have trouble blending this product, apply the foundation and spray a setting spray. I use the rose water spray (my skin is oily and red, but you can use whichever one) don't saturate it though! Just a couple of sprays and blend with the brush. I find it to be a lot easier but I almost never need to use the spray. Other than that it's amazing"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Miss Keri","New Jersey",5,"I love this product. I don't have to wear a concealer if I choose not to. All day coverage with little to no touch up. Matches my skin tone extremely well."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Kat","Denver, Colorado",4,"I thought this product was great. Except for blending. Blending was difficult at best. But if you put enough time into blending it out, the product is worth the buy.<br />*i did find this product to have a drying effect on my skin, so if you are already a dry skinned person, this may not be the best product for you."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Danielle","Arizona",5,"I love this product!! I great concealer that also provided slight contouring l, blends well with a sponge. I recommend it all the time"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Priscilla Riley","Saginaw mi",2,"I think it could cover more and I wish I would have brought a lighter color for under my eyes"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Dana","Louisiana",5,"I really liked this product. It provided full coverage without settling into the fine lines."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Sunny","Tennessee",4,"I use this over a mineral sunscreen as a concealer / light foundation. It covers fairly well, stays reasonably matte, and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Three of the shades work pretty well with my fair skin without looking pasty. I love the extra sun protection it gives, and it's fantastic for travel. <br /><br />On the down side, it goes on a tiny bit dry for me. I would definitely need a good moisturizer underneath if I were not already using my sunscreen. It doesn't hold up more than 6-8 hours, but that seems like a fair trade-off for such light and natural-looking coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Little Red","WA",4,"I don't think I get flawless coverage - I really think there's no such thing as flawless - but I still get pretty darn good coverage.  I usually have to do a couple touch-ups throughout the day, but overall, I like this."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","AS","Cumming, GA",5,"I have problems finding a makeup that blends with my fair skin (blonde hair &amp; green eyes) but yet is not greasy or oily.  This is the best makeup I have found.  No liquid mess, no oily greasy transfer to clothes.  This is so easy to apply and I use it every day as my foundation.  I just apply to cheeks, nose, chin, forehead and blend.  It blends amazingly with my skin and there is no line along my chin.  I have combination skin and this has not clogged my pores or caused any break outs.  The best part is it has 20 spf in it so I am protecting my skin and looking great!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","rbkh","New York, NY",3,"this concealer is great for spots as it goes on creamy and covers redness.  Downside is that is has absolutely no staying power and disappears in about an hour; also, it tends to break up around areas you may move/touch often like around the eyes, mouth, nose, and chin. if you don't mind touching up often, this is great, and reapplying causes no caking issues (because it really just doesn't last so it's like you never had any on)."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Budget P","Pasadena, CA",5,"I dont use a lot of foundation so I was looking for something that would go on smoothly and this was great. Wish they had more color variety but I thought it was great. Will definitely use it a lot in the summer when I'm looking for something light and easy to apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","amber e","Oakland, CA",5,"This almost doesn't need to be blended - it applies and seems to melt right into the skin. Incredibly natural appearance, I can use this under my (middle-aged) eyes and it doesn't crease or cake or look like I'm wearing anything there. Most products are obvious and make that area look worse, not better. I haven't used it as a full  face foundation, more as a spot-application to cover darkness, and it works well. I'm not sure I've ever tried a product quite like this.<br /><br />I use a tiny concealer brush to apply this right where I need it. It's fantastic for anyone who needs light to medium natural looking coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Rowie","Washington State",4,"Great when you're in a hurry.  Dab on the nose, forehead and chin and blend with a sponge or your fingertips.  Medium coverage in 10 seconds<br />Great for touch ups too<br />I will always bring this when I travel"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Esa","Peoria ok",5,"I really like this foundation stick. It's quick, coverage is good, feels very light on my skin, and portable. I set it with powder and it lasts through my work day"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Kristen","Boulder, CO",5,"Use it every day in some way or another!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Mommabear","USA",3,"I purchased this in store after looking at reviews online I'm a new mom and was completely out of all my makeup and need to get new essentials and decided on this because of the rating. It's not the best coverage but it's okay it's easy to apply and what I need with not having as much time as I use to to do my makeup I wish it had more coverage but I'm satisfied with it"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Little Red","WA",4,"This is easy to apply and is less messy than my liquid foundation.  I use it when I'm pressed for time.  Wears off a little throughout the day, but overall, I like it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Alex","Illinois",4,"It's not bad I use it as a base over my acne and redness before i put on my foundation and it normally lasts long. I would recommend using a foam blender that's more firm than a brush or finger because it is a stick and more thick."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Makeuplover","South Carolina",5,"Great product! Love the way it works!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Kate","Long island",5,"It blended so well with my face and once it's rubbed in you don't feel like you're wearing makeup. I love the idea of the tube design. I just rub it in with my fingers or my brush. Definitely buying again."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-insta-fix-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791035","Donna","Virginia Beach,  va",5,"All I can say is the Revlon Stick Foundation is awesome!!  It compares or performs better than some of the high end stick formulas I have tried.  It blends well and makes your complexion appear flawless.  It lasts the entire day, I love this foundation!  I only wish I had tried it sooner,  I would have saved a lot of money!"
