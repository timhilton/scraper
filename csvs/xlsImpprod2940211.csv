I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.  To begin, I love this formula.  It's creamy and pigmented and has a nice, satin finish.  Unlike the onslaught of bone-dry matte lipsticks I constantly wear, this lipstick doesn't leave my lips looking crusty at the end of the day.  It's pretty long-wearing for a satin lipstick, and when it fades, it fades with dignity.  The only reason why I'm not giving it a full  5 stars is because the color I got is literally lighter than my skin right now.  Maybe when I get a few foundation colors lighter by wintertime, I'll actually be able to wear this on its own instead of mixing it with a duskier pink when I contour my lips or do an ombre, but when I wear it right now, my mouth just looks like an unsightly seam covered in too-light concealer.  Not cute.  If you've got skin darker than practically any shade than the lightest foundation in any given line, I would be very aware that the color Nude attitude is almost like concealer since there aren't any underlying rosy tones."

I've tried several other brands and just feel like Revlon lipstick is smooth, easy to apply. Revlon lipsticks are a classic for a reason. This lipstick is butter soft and non-drying, Revlon has a huge range of colors, from the palest nudes to the brightest reds. The pigmentation is great with this lipstick and it feels great to wear, a nice soft glossy finish. When it comes to beauty products for my lips, I am very picky. I look for a lip color that makes me feel and look good both from inside and outside. Revlon super lustrous Black Cherry is one brand and the type of lipstick that I will keep going back to for this purpose.

The black tube with gold detail is simple and classy - exactly how I think a lipstick should look. I received the shade Black Cherry, which, I have to admit, I wasn't too excited about. I've never been one to wear darker lip shades, and this deep, burgundy shade is one I would usually steer pretty clear from. But, it swatched beautifully on the hand, so I quickly found a mirror and put it on.<br /><br />This lipstick applies BEAUTIFULLY. It's rich and pigmented and very, very creamy, and went on like a dream. It's soft and moisturizing, and has just the right amount of shine to it, leaving your lips looking full and supple. It may not be a shade I would ever pick for myself, but the formula itself is absolutely fantastic, and has me wanting to try out all the other shades. <br />I've often had issues with other brand of darker shades like this going on patchy or streaky, which is one of the reasons I tend to stick away from these dark colors, but that is not the case with this lipstick. <br /><br />I really have to applaud Revlon of this formula, and I can't wait to try more!<br /><br />*This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

That is some serious color haha. It's beautiful but it is INTENSE. Definitely a keeper for Halloween (or a Depeche Mode concert) but probably not practical for me in every day life (being a very pasty white girl with red hair). This is surprisingly moisturizing and creamy, I would just recommend you scrub your lips with a toothbrush or a face scrub to remove any dry lip skin before applying or it can look a little crusty. The case is awesome, I absolutely love that you can see the color through the top of the case (where has this been all my life?).

I did not love this product, first off the color that was sent to me was a bit to light for me (in my opinion). Secondly it went on very streaky at first so you do need to work with it a little. The last thing I personally do not like about this product is that is enhanced the dry spots on my lips, it wasn't cute, but nothing a lip scrub wouldn't fix. It was creamy and very lightweight on the lips which is a huge plus since lip product tend to bother me throughout the day."

I'm truly not used to deep rich colors like this one, but I really thought it looked good, prominent, fierce against my fair skin tone. I could see this color going great with a deep outlined eye, and a thick filled in eyebrow. Very deep beautiful color.

I mainly say this because I thought it gave me poor coverage, If the coverage improved than I would definately buy this in the future because I like the color options and They make a bold statement. Overall it was easy to apply and went on smoothly it's just a coverage problem for me and the vavaviolet color was a little to dark for me personally.

It goes on smooth and buttery, and it won't dry your lips out.  Now, I did not find it to be a completely flat matte finish.  I think it's more of a velvet finish if anything.  Honestly, I don't mind because of the comfort of the wear.  In terms of how long it wears, it is a traditional lipstick so I don't expect the same kind of wear-time as a matte liquid lipstick.  It will come off on things that you eat or drink, but the color does remain on your lips for a few hours.  That means minimal touch-ups throughout the day.  I has fair-light skin with neutral/warm undertones.  The shade Nude Attitude is a perfect pale nude for me!  Definitely recommend, especially for $5!

Its a nice dark and bold violet color, that transfers on your lips smoothly! The shape of the lipstick makes it easy to apply.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.&quot; I received this product from Crowdtap for free in exchange for my honest opinion. All opinions are 100% my own. I have used Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick, and I have enjoyed the lush colors and moisture. However, Va Va Violet is a bit on the patchy side to start with (which seems to be a big issue with ultra dark colors), so using a dark lip liner would be helpful to reduce the patchiness. Plus, the ultra dark plum is not terrific against my coloring---I resemble a &quot;goth girl&quot; in a bad way. Other than that, the product itself is nice, but this particular color is problematic, but solvable, if you know what to do."

However, you do have to reapply every so often, as it is not very long-lasting.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this product (especially this particular shade)!

Every color I've tried has been completely opaque in either one or a few swipes. They all look great. The only con is that on some of the pinks, they'll oxidize on my lips and turn fuchsia.

It looks very pretty online, and with a name like Blushing Nude it seems like it would be a rosy, pinky, nude color. Since it's a drugstore brand it's wrapped in plastic and you can't swatch it so I had to take it home to try it. When I opened the tube, I was surprised by how much warmer the color was. Definitely not a &quot;Blushing Nude.&quot; It's more of a Brick-ish red color, but on the more natural side, not a total red. It is very pretty and it's definitely in the running for my wedding, but I would never consider it a nude."

Pink Cloud is my absolute favorite lipstick EVER! The glossy, moisturizing feel is so wonderful, the sheer, cool pink color is so beautiful- it's petty much The Perfect Lipstick. I wear it alone or with every lipstick I put on, no matter what the brand. I even wear it while I sleep, it's that moisturizing! But sadly, even though I know it's popular with other customers besides me, when I went to my ULTA store today, the moisturizing Super Lustrous line was gone, taken out in a reset. I had hoped to buy at least two more of Pink Cloud, or 4 or 6 if they had it (it sells so quickly, that never happens!), but it was discontinued at my store. I hope this does not mean it's discontinued entirely, or it'll be back to Clinque lipstick for me, and this time, I'm not coming back."

Time and time again I find myself reaching for these lipsticks first, and buy the same colors over and over. They stay on all day, are smooth, even and don't dry out my lips.

It's a barely there nude-pink color... On me that is. On dark skin tones I imagine it would be more frosty, but I'm very pale. Perfect for winter time, paired with a light, icy eyeshadow. The texture's nice. No feathering."

However I have some of the creams and I like them too. I'm picky about the taste that some companies have and Revlon doesn't give me a weird after taste. The pearls last longer than the creams but I have both."

You can't even tell that it's orange. I put on about 20 layers before you could see a difference between the lipstick and my actual lips. Notmally I am the least picky person when it comes to cosmetics, and I have low expectations, but this met none of them."

I love high end lines (and have even worked for a few of them) but RSLL ranks up there with the best of them. Decades ago, I stayed away from this line because the lipsticks had a strong fragrance that bothered my allergies. This is no longer the case. They have a terrific range of shades. Of course, there are no testers which is a pain, but I've been successful by trying to stick to shades that look like ones I would buy in any line. I am fair and cool toned with dark hair, and I really like Plumalicious, Plum Velour and Mauvy Nights. I wouldn't buy anything extreme- if you're not used to Bright Red, or never look good in Orange or Brown, you won't like the Revlon versions just because they're less expensive.

My first reaction when putting it on was how rich the colour was. It was a beautiful, rich and dark purple. It held up decently while eating and drinking but probably would have been better to use a lip pencil before applying Va Va Violet on my lips. The colour is fantastic but not a shade for everyday use(at least for me.) The Super Lustrous Lipstick was also very creamy and soft on my lips. <br />The one downside is that the packaging is pretty boring and generic. <br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

While seeming to moisture my lips a bit when applied. Great product, just not a fan of the color I received."

It wears off after you eat but stains remain on your lips and yuo don't need touch up unless you want to have its real color on your lips. Overall it's a great buy. I had few which were little glossier but dint like them much as much as I love the Matt ones. Some has glossier texture some are Matt and some are little runny on on your lips as in after u apply it slides down the lip line so be sure to check the texture."

I'm more of a dry, matte lipstick lover and Revlon is a little more dry but it's not a gloss or balm, so it's pretty average for a normal lipstick. It smooths on easy and it always has vibrant colors! Last color I purchased was 'Primrose' which is a light purple/ pale purple color,(my favorite color is the 'Orange Flip') and it was a little bit too light for me. I hate it when my lips look washed out or nude. It appears as if you can't see them. I am medium skinned so that may be why. However, I still havent returned this product and I am finding myself wanting and actually using it more and more. My only concern is that sometimes the product bleeds in the lines outside my lips. It's only happened a few times so it could possibly be a flaw in that formula batch but when I use a primer and liner lip it stops the bleeding."

It is impossible to buy on line, the color swatches have little to do with the actual color.  The color choices in the pink family seem very much the same, and they don't seem very pigmented with few exception.  There is a difference between being heavy and pigmented if you know what I mean.  I am olive skinned with green undertones (it isn't easy being green) and my favorite shade is Sassy Mauve which isn't mauve at all but a deep pink (VS bright pink).  The tubes are a pain to snap closed, often I find the lid off my lipstick because it really didn't snap on.  Which they would fix.  Mostly, I wish they would do the smear of the actual lipstick so we could really see an accurate color representation.  I would recommend a friend go to Ulta and try on, no buy online."

With that said I didn't care too much for the application, I had to apply several layers for it to be even and a nice overall color. It went on almost like a clear gloss in a creamy lipstick form, which means the color isn't really there without adding more layers. So if your looking for something less dramatic you can just apply 1 or 2 layers and even it out, but if your like me and love color you will have to apply more which means that it will come off easier and you'll need to apply more often.

Lipsticks don't exactly look that great on me but this color is fantastic. It lasts about an hour before I feel like I have to reapply it and because I'm not too into lipsticks I guess I'm okay with the lasting ability. I also bought black cherry which I can't wait to try and I think that would be the ultimate test to see how long that color will last because it is so easy to see it fade as oppose to Prim Rose which is so close to the natural color of my lips. I've been wearing Prim Rose almost everyday! Obsessed."

For the day if I'm not trying to make a statement then I simply just dab/pat my lips with my finger for a more stained-effect which is a little bit more subtle than applying from the bullet.<br />Also, it is a trend color and if you are a lipstick addict this is another color for your collection and its AFFORDABLE!

It was a blackish purple in the tube, but when applied to my lips it was a dark plum color. It didn't go on very smooth. However, when on it wasn't drying and actually felt good. It didn't feel sticky or clumpy. I'd love to try this product in a different color."

I normally try to stay away from bolder shades but I really liked this one. The shade is like a dark cherry red. I think it makes a great fall color.  The lipstick itself is really creamy and glides on easily. I love the feel of it on my lips. The lipstick doesn't dry my lips out. They stay hydrated and I love the long wear of the lipstick too. It lasted about 5 or so hours for me and I didn't experience any drying out or flaking issues. Color went on fairly evenly. It feels creamy and doesn't look overly shiny either which is a plus for me.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I love the shades Raisin Rage, Rum Raisin, and Standout in their matte balm. At any rate, Super Lustrous lipstick is more like a longwear stain that is definitely not opaque like matte lipstick. On my lips, they appear as a wash of color more than a very bold and thick coating of lipstick. Likewise, they do also emphasize fine lines and imperfections, so expect that. They tend to be quite drying as well, due to the adherent in the product. On the plus side, this makes them longer wearing than the average lipstick, so you may not need to reapply for several hours, unless you eat or drink. I currently have four colors thus far, and will likely purchase more in the future."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","elcamino","Philadelphia, PA",4,"This is my favorite lipstick brand of the drugstore variety. And because I am too cheap to buy 30-dollar designer lipsticks, and since the color variety is so great that you're bound to find something to suit you, Revlon's earned my loyalty. I have this in multiple colors - Really Red (Matte), Certainly Red, Kiss Me Coral, Rose Velvet, Teak Rose, Pink in the Afternoon. Kiss Me Coral always gets me tons of compliments - for my fellow fair-skinned ladies, I think it's a very flattering bright coral shade. Rose Velvet and Teak Rose I just purchased - Rose Velvet is a slightly darker shade of my natural lip color, and Teak Rose has a bit more red in it. I think I'll wear a lot of both in the fall. But hands down, Pink in the Afternoon is my absolute favorite. It's the &quot;my lips but better&quot; shade that I wear almost daily, just enough to look polished. I've stocked up on multiple tubes of that shade alone, just in the event they stop making it (please Revlon Gods, don't let that happen!).<br /><br />While color selection and the creamy formula are great, this lipstick does not have serious staying power, so be prepared for frequent reapplication. Particularly for the darker shades, keep a compact mirror handy in case you start to get the dreaded ring from fading - I drink coffee or water all day, so that's the biggest culprit for me. But still, for the price, it's great overall, and I totally recommend it."

I typically don't like actual lipsticks because I find that they tend to be somewhat drying and often have an unpleasant taste but this formula was a pleasant surprise in some ways.  It wasn't nearly as drying as some of the other lipsticks that I've tried and although I wouldn't say that it tasted &quot;good&quot;, it wasn't bad, either.  The color was a little bit patchy and I had to reapply it to really get good coverage for any length of time but it may have been because of the dark color and a lighter color may not have been as obvious.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.  I received shade number 663, Va Va Violet, to review.  When I first saw how dark this lipstick shade is, I was a little nervous because dark lipstick usually isn't my thing!  It's such a dark purple that in some lights it almost looks black in the container.  In sunlight, it definitely looks more purple.  When applied, it isn't nearly as dark as it appears in the container.  On me, it looked more like a raisin/plum color and it was a little more sheer than I thought it would be.  Both of these things made me happy.  I did notice that it wore off quite easily, much faster than some other lip products I have tried, but about as quickly as most drugstore brand lipstick products.  Overall, I would just say this lipstick is average."

It is a lovely, flattering color, it's fairly pigmented, the packaging is elegant and the price is great. It can get a stick to the dry patches of my lips a little, so I just apply it over by lip balm. Another thing is that it has a pearly finish, which a lot of people don't like, but it isn't really frosty, so I don't mind it. Overall this is a great product and would repurchase it."

It's a very pretty darker shade with a dark purple look that makes my hair and eyes pop. I like how this lipstick is very dark and deep that it looks like a brownish tint as well but the pretty purple still comes through. I love how this looks on my light ivory skin as well. I can see this being a nice shade to wear for summer or when it get's colder out as well. This goes well with all the colors of the clothes I'm wearing.

The texture is nice and creamy, and it applies very smoothly. The lipstick doesn't really have a scent to it. It's as long-wearing as most lipsticks, but it does come off if you were to eat or drink. The color is not very pigmented, so you would need to apply several coats. It has a matte appearance, but not drying at all.

But I got a chance to try Revlon super lustrous lipstick in black cherry color. When I opened this the color actually scared me because I usually go for the very light, subtle look and this in the tube looks like a dark plumb color. When you apply it to your lips though the color is more of a red wine color, very bold in my opinion. The lipstick is very creamy and goes on smoothly but I felt you had to swipe a few times to get full coverage of the color. But also not sure if it was just me not being used to actual lipstick. Once on, my lips felt very moist so it didn't seem drying at all, actually seemed quite moisturizing. Now because of the bold color I would only use this product on a brave night out, but that's just me. Im glad I was able to try this because its not a color I would have ever chosen and it wasn't as bad as I originally thought a deep color would look so maybe with a few uses ill become brave enough to try other bold colors.  *this review is sponsored by Revlon and crowdtap as a sampling activation.

I have tried a ton of lipsticks, but this one tops them all (Milani, Covergirl, etc.). I love how creamy and &quot;nude&quot; it feels on my lips. It is not sticky, or runny, it simply stays put. I work in a corporate office and I love wearing it. I reapply it only because I love reapplying it! It is a very long wearing lipstick and lasts through endless cups of coffee. I like the shade, because it is not too bright, very professional. If you do not like shimmer, you would not like this shade. It wears at least 7 hours before you NEED to reapply. <br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

This color is much darker than I would normally pick but it's a very bold, nice look for fall or winter. Keeping my eye makeup more neutral, it gives a nice appearance. I especially like it when I dab it slightly with a tissue after applying to leave more of a nice stain. It is moisturizing, but not quite enough for me. Thus the 4 star instead of 5. My lips are always dry so I like to apply Revlon Kiss balm first. Very nice lipstick though I do prefer lip crayons more for their moisturizing benefits.<br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I'm glad I did. Such lovely colors and they don't dry out my lips. I normally don't wear much besides lip balm because my lips dry and peel so easily and lipstick often dries them out more. Haven't had that issue with this and I wore it all day yesterday. Yes it will fade with regular eating and drinking but it stays put otherwise. I love the shade Rose and Shine because it's a nice rosy color for my lips. Champagne on Ice is a perfect nude color too and will look fantastic come summer.<br /><br /> Highly recommended this lovely lipstick and all the shades it comes in."

Revlon's Super Lustrous Lipstick in Nude Attitude is a perfect nude flesh color lipstick. Its very smooth and creamy. Easy to apply. It has no scent whatsoever. While I really like the shade, it didn't look great on me. However, when I paired it with several different brown colored lip liners, I got beautiful results. Reminded me of the looks from the 90's. For a more subtle and softer lip look I wear it with a little pink color lip liner. I love the packaging because the top shows you the color of the lipstick. So you basically get to see the color you are getting. I would advise to exfoliate lips prior to using this product because if you have dry lips it will show.

I also had no problem applying it evenly on my lips (as opposed to the Ultra HD in Infatuation lipstick that I also sampled). It was moisturizing and I like that the texture is not sticky and actually felt really soft, smooth and hydrating. The only con was: It's not long lasting, I mean with these kinds of lipstick you would really expect it to fade within hours but it's easy to reapply anyway so it's all good.

This lipstick leaves my lips soft and hydrated no drying at all and the Primrose would be attractive on any skin tones. I gave a 4 instead of a 5 because it does wear off after a few hours but then I love applying lipstick so that isn't really much of a problem for me."

I don't typically like stick lipsticks, because I find them difficult to put on and they don't dry as well as liquid lipsticks, so I think they smudge easier. This was definitely one of the better lipsticks I've tried. It was matte as it promised, which I was happily surprised about. I think that if I had gotten a different color I would wear it more often. While it is a really good nude color, nude lipsticks make me look washed out. This lipstick wasn't drying in anyway. Although I think this is a good product, I most likely won't be wearing it due to the color."

Pleasantly, my experience was a positive one.  I was excited by the Super Lustrous Lipstick in that the application is smooth and easy; which is difficult to find in a lipstick, since many tend to be too hard, and therefore difficult to apply evenly.  Plus, although the shade was on the darker side, it looked neat and precise - all the while reflecting a cherry glow once on the lips, which was a bit lighter than in the tube.  Additionally, the creamy quality lent well and made me feel as though this product was of high quality.  For these reasons, I have dubbed this product five out of five stars.  I would definitely purchase this product, although perhaps in a different shade (since this was a bit dark for my skin tone) and would definitely recommend this product to a friend or family member.

So let me just say it. I'm basic. But that's not the point. I'm just not a makeup buff. I do not slay. So if your looking for that kind of review this is not it. Plumalicious and rum raisin are the two that I selected. They go on smooth and even. Plumalicious is a pearl which im suprised by how much I like. It's a very subtle sheen and the color is very quiet. Its by no means a statement as much as a soft kiss of color. Very tasteful especially for darker hair. Rum raisin is a cream which I love. It's a different take on a red lip that I quite like. Its not like it's a color thats working really hard to keep her man's attention or anything like that. It's a nude red and you can stain your lips really nicely with it. I actually think this is a sexy color. ( rum raisin ) If you do want to be bombshell I feel like you could do this color with a really smokey eye. Because I think the really sexy  girl draws less attention to her lips than she does to her eyes. She leaves her lips kissable. But don't let me tell you how to wear your makeup. All I'm saying is these are really sexy colors if you want to play it kind of cool for a day."

I like the colors but I wish they would be even darker and more vibrant...  I'm not the kind to go spend over $10 on lipstick.  It doesn't stay very well but it also doesn't fade very easily if that makes sense.  It also doesn't apply evenly... All in all I still like it."

The first one I owned is Goldplum and first, I find the color to be really pretty! It looks nice for anytime of the day for me and I just feel so pretty and confident whenever I wear it. From that moment, I feel like I have the lipstick for a long time since I had it. Now, I wanted to go a little bold and I got WIld Orchid as my second lipstick to own and I got a lot of compliments wearing it. It's so vibrant and I love the blue-like undertones of it and it worked well with my complexion. Best of all, it doesn't fade out. It last for a long time, and a little touch up isn't so bad but I love it a lot! I want to get more to increase my collection."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","lpwimsey","chicago, IL",4,"It's a beautiful color and feels smooth going on. Pretty pigmented so that you can wear it blotted for a toned down look or full on for very dramatic burgundy lips. <br /><br />Do exfoliate your lips because you absolutely will be able to see every dry spot ever. It can settle a little into lines, but blotting and applying a 2nd coat should take care of that problem.  That being said, it was pretty comfortable to wear and I don't feel the need to layer it with a balm or anything. <br /><br />It is, however, the shortest lasting lipstick that I own. Like, I sat around for 2 hours working at a desk indoors, not eating or drinking and the whole thing managed to fade in the meantime.  I wasn't wearing liner, but it was still ridiculous how it just disappeared. Never had another lipstick do that."

I found one Tarte lip that I loved but I hated the idea of paying over $20 for lip product so I also swatched some Revlon lipsticks (because they have an amazing color selection.) I used a tissue and wiped off all the products I swatched and the Revlon actually stayed on a bit better than the stila products and some of the Tarte. The only one that was significantly longer lasting than the Revlon was the Tarte lip paints - but I was willing to sacrifice the $20 lip paint for a much cheaper alternative. I've been happy with the Revlon pick - the color was exactly what I was looking for and some of it wears off throughout the day, but not completely. It's almost like a stain, as long as you don't wipe it completely with a cloth. I'm satisfied with the quality granted the price I paid."

The Caramel Glace shade is a nice warm nude lipstick that works well with fall clothing which is what I was hoping it would be. It has a nice pearl finish that is slightly glossy/shiny looking on my lips. The Cherries in the Snow shade is a brighter pinkish red color. It is not overly bright and it works well with red and pink clothing. It is not a true red but it is a nice lipstick shade that looks good on me. I have fair skin and some red lipsticks don't look good on me, but this one is nice looking and not over done looking on me. This lipstick lasts a long time on me even when I have drank drinks while wearing it which is nice. I also find this lipstick to be moisturizing for my dry lips which is a plus. I like that this lipstick comes in a lot of nice shades and I will definitely be trying more shades of this lipstick in the future."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","pinehillgirl","Louisiana",5,"I bought several shades of this lipstick in colors that are supposed to work well for someone with a fair complexion.  I have been happy with each one: Cherries in the Snow, Iced Amethyst, Spicy Cinnamon, Sultry Samba, Mauvy Night, and Certainly Red.  Cherries in the Snow looks the brightest on me.  The other shades simply look like my lips, only better.  I think I like Spicy Cinnamon the best.  They do need to be reapplied after eating.  They don't dry my lips or make them feel funny, not sticky or anything like that.  Also, no unpleasant tastes or smells."

It was smooth with no weird smell like some have. It was not as pigmented as I had hoped it would be and it will show any dryness you have in your lips. It's kind of bright in my opinion when I was expecting a pinkish color it was more a bit on the orange side. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I do not buy drug store makeup, I wear high end brands and have spent well of $30 on a single lipstick but I ALWAYS have at least 3-4 of these in my bag/truck/luggage as back up. They feel like Chapstick and never dry out my lips (I surf and spend a lot of time outdoors so I know chapped lips). I have to reapply to keep color vibrancy but it wears away evenly and blends into my natural color. No clumping or waxy residue. I'm not a fan of the pearl colors, I think they're too shimmery, but I wear the flat colors often. Favorites: Velvet Rose, Mauvy Night, Dimure, Teak Rose, Sassy Mauve, Black Cherry"

It's a little much for me but I like to put a layer of Revlon's Primrose color over this to tone it down a bit. Really a gorgeous color that I would recommend to anyone looking to try coral. It does require some gloss or balm though as its a little dry."

I own Pink In The Afternoon, Love that Pink, Rose Velvet, Demure, Berry Rich, and Coralberry. I read many reviews before buying any of these to see if they would be good for my skintone, I know my lips very well and what will look good on and these don't dissapoint. I know alot of people complain about color but you can't expect for all 72 colors to look good on you. for example, if youre a redhead buying Love that Pink expect to look like a clown.<br />I have never fallen in love with lipsticks before, i have like 6 or 7 MAC lipsticks that my makeup buddy has given me and I like them I just didnt go crazy over them, some of them are too soft and fall over :( I really only like the luster ones from MAC but they are kind of sheer. That being said Revlon makes better lipsticks for my budget and for my taste! all of the ones I own except for demure are very pigmented :) they are all so nice to apply too! I love love love the texture of these lippies and I love pulling out my sleek black and gold tubes!!! These have a very satisfying click when you close them and they are not so heavy in your purse as MAC lipsticks are. These are between 5ish and 7ish dollars where ive found them and most of the time there are revlon coupons and bogo sales so you really have nothing to lose in trying these out. I've never felt so ladylike and classic until I got these and I love that some of the shades have been around for more than half a century. This has convinced me to never buy an expensive lippie again. If you want to know more about each shade i've reviewed all of the ones I own. Thank you so much Revlon for making such a gem! i always exfoliate my lips at night and in the morning and then i put on a light coat of burts bees while i do my makeup and swipe on my lipstick before i go out the door. These are already very light on the lips (not heavy at all) but I just really like to have balm on. these dont really need it however)<br />forgot to add that these got VERY low toxicity ratings so they are great for your lips!!!!"

That doesn't keep me from using it however, because I can easily do the retro 60s look with this color, when pale lips were really in.  I also like to put this color on under a pale pink gloss for a little drama."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","Sandy","Somewhere East..!",5,"I have this color in Demure, and I love it so much! It's really nice because it evens out easily on your lips and it leaves a nice finish! I also think that the packaging is convenient because of the clear top, how if you have a lot of different lipsticks you can look, and within seconds you know if thats the one your looking for! I keep this color in my purse for a quick and easy application!"

I usually buy the $.99-1.00 from a local beauty supply store. (DON'T JUDGE ME!) After I applied this product in Violet Frenzy, I was astonished! It went on smoothly and it moisturized my lips incredibly. It has become one of favorites. I'm definitely going to buy more. BUT--&gt; If you think this lipstick is going to last through drinks and a meal, trust me it will not."

Anywho, I expected the color to rich and instead it was thin. I had to put on multiple applications just to build up the color only to have it disappear five minutes later. I would not by this again."

I got apricot fantasy because I was looking for a orangey/peachy color since tangerine is the &quot;in&quot; color this season for makeup. And tadaaaa I swatched this on my hand and it looked soo good. On my lips it looks just as great too. It is kind of a nude color with peach undertone.. if that makes sense lol. And its moisturizing too! When I tried it on, my lips were completely dry and after application it felt like a tinted lipbalm. Yayyy good purchase :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","Jenn","Greensboro, NC",4,"I like this lipstick.  I am not an expert in lipsticks, but I like the colors and it does last a reasonable amount of time.  It does come off on coffee cups, straws, etc. but I expected that.  If that is a deal breaker for you, then keep looking."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","Leahv","Stockton, CA",2,"I really like the color, it's pretty and works for every occasion. The application goes on a bit chalky and clumpy, I would recommend using chap stick first and then a gloss over the lipstick."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","Glo","El Paso, Tx",4,"Totally would buy again, but would suggest experimenting with color since I have to mix it with another color to get the just right color for my skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","Erin","Long Beach, CA",3,"After spending more than I should have on Mac lipsticks, I decided to try a more affordable lipstick. I tried a light purple, a dark purple, and a nudey brown. The nude color is wonderful and one of my go to lipsticks, gorgeous color and lasts a while. However, the light and dark colors were both streaky on my lips and very sheer. I had to swipe at least four times to get an even application. I'm hoping it's just those colors and I'm willing to give other colors the benefit of the doubt."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod2940211","Happy2Shop21","Tustin, CA",5,"I love the bright colors<br />-Cherries in the snow<br />-Fuchsia fusion<br />-Wild orchid<br /><br />They glide on well and seem to be pretty pigmented for a drugstore band. They don't have any nasty taste, or strange smells. They feel more matte on the lip but don't feel drying. I wouldn't call these a long wearing formula, but you get what you pay for. I'm pretty fair skinned and get many compliments when I wear these fun bold colors. Over all I'm very pleased with these and will purchase more in the future."
