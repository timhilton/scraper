I use a primer and it lasts a full work day, about 9 hours. The shade selection is weird, I'm usually a lot lower on the shade scale and I had to use Natural Beige to get a good match."

It looked cakey on my dry skin especially around my mouth area. It gave me that weird texture on the on my cheeks. I tried this for 4 days and I couldn't deal with it. It was so cakey after 1 hour of wearing this foundation."

I have combo oily skin with a lot of acne marks and current breakouts, so texture is a bit of an issue. this covers beautifully and makes your skin look very smooth. It is very thick, so I find that if you spread it out with your fingers then blend with a sponge is the best method. I have no complaints with this other than it started to break up the tiniest bit around my chin at the 4-5hr mark. it didn't settle into my pores or lines, looked really flawless. I would repurchase!"

I bought this at a drugstore because my local Ulta didn't yet have this in stock.  Ulta had sent me the face and neck primer as a platinum perk, and I was impressed so I wanted to try the foundation.  I really wasn't sure about the shade, because porcelain is numbered higher than ivory, and I'm usually an ivory shade... I went with porcelain thinking it was slightly darker but a tad cooler toned which I need. Unfortunately it was wayyyy too light for me.  I exchanged it for ivory.  Still too light.  Went back for buff and it's STILL too light but I can make it work.  I'd suggest definitely purchasing somewhere you can swatch shades! It's a thick consistency, almost too thick for my preferences.  I tried it with a beauty blender and had strange results.  It blended eventually but took a lot of work.  I mean a LOT.  I don't usually experience that with a sponge application.  Brush application was also odd.  It's like the product just did not want to adhere to my skin and blend in at all.  Finally I just dotted it on then went in with my fingers to blend and meld it in, and used a sponge as a final smoothing and blending step.  That gave me good coverage and the least patchy application. <br /><br />Here's where it gets good: after a few minutes on my skin, it just looked unbelievably smooth and poreless.  It looked beautiful, with a natural finish bordering more on matte than dewy, high coverage without looking heavy or cakey, felt lightweight and feather soft, and definitely didn't look patchy in the slightest.  My skin certainly looks smoother when I wear this, younger, fewer lines and pores visible. <br /><br />So I'm going to keep trying different primers to see if they help application, but even if they don't, I'll keep using this because the effort is worth the final result.<br /><br />I have dry skin, and it did not make it appear any dryer than normal, but I would not call this hydrating as the product description state"

This settled into pores and fine lines, clung to dry patches on my forehead and just had a patchy appearance.  Will play with it some more using different brushes and sponge....so far not good...."

"http://www.ulta.com/youth-fx-fill-blur-foundation?productId=xlsImpprod15931003","Sarah","Ireland",2,"To be honest, I really was routing for this foundation. I really wanted it to work but I don't think it was the best choice for my dry skin. It was difficult to blend out on my forehead and product wouldn't apply to my nose. It looked very blotchy on both these areas and it didn't cover any of my blemishes. I also found it to be quite tacky so I had to use loads of powder which made my dry skin even drier."

So I'm mixing it with another shade that I apply with a brush and it's working well . The make up is great my face just isn't the same shade it was before and it was my error"
