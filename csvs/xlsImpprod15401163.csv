This is not the correct color for me.  The pencil seems to work fine and it stays on all day without fading.  I have had to doctor it up some because the color needed to be darker.  So don't take this as the pencil is bad...just the blonde color on me.  I took back one blonde after buying two and traded it in for the brown which was not in stock when I went in to buy it.  This is the closest to the Ulta brow &quot;chubby&quot; that I used to use which they have now discontinued.  Once I have used the brown I will make another statement about the pencil."

This product was so greasy. It made my eyebrows wet. I chose it originally because I liked that it was a thicker stick and not a tiny skinny one. But it was not good for my brows!"

I like this product, it does a good job filling in my thin brows. I will probably be buying a small brow comb because I miss not being able to smooth and shape my brows after applying color."
