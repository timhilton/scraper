The color is very watery looking - it almost has a brownish look, even though it is supposed to be black.  The Revlon Classic Eye Pen was much better - a bold, black color as I had expected.  Don't bother with the ballpoint version..."

First of all the cap is very difficult to get off so I end up getting it all over my hands when I have to tug the cap off. The liquid comes out inconsistently so part of the time you get a nice clean line and the other half it looks like a smudged mess. The only good thing I will say is that when the liquid is coming out correctly you do get a nice clean tight line."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Naomi","San Antonio",3,"This product is okay, the ball point for me is useless, and can get in the way, it also smells rather bad like a sharpie or highlighter. I wouldnt buy this product again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Emilie","Pennsylvania",3,"Stayed on for 10+ hours, easy application. Doesn't run or smudge."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Hpnelson","Moss Point, MS",5,"The only complaint would be that you have to layer it for it to be dark enough!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Ber","Athens, Ga",4,"This product is so easy to apply. It stays on all day. It's inexpensive and works better than expensive products I've used."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Nikki","Deerfield Beach, FL",3,"I really do not use the wing for my look that often but when I do I really like the liquid pen, its easier to work with it goings on smooth its long lasting you usually can not go wrong. I just did not like the tip of this particular tip. The tip because its rounded its easy to smudge, easily runs, VERY thick. I personally like the thin wing but that is me and thats why this product for what I was looking was not it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","maaya","Syracuse, NY",2,"I saw the high rating and thought I'd try it. I have liquid liner pens that I like from Asia (Physician's Formula is also excellent since it's made in Japan), but those are brush tips, and I wanted the control of a felt tip. I like to just do a thin line, since I usually go for natural style. I do like the ball point which makes it easy to use to dot across the lash line, but it began to run shortly after applying and gave me panda eyes, which is disappointing since usually liquid liners don't run so easily (though Western brands tend to smudge more than Asian brands). I don't think it's worth returning, but I'm disappointed.<br /><br />I will note that I used it on my lash line, which of course makes it more susceptible to smudging. If you use it on your lid, it may do a bit better..."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","CoralChristina","Madison, MS",5,"I've tried other brands of liquid eyeliner, including NYX which is my favorite brand, but the Revlon is the best."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Sheila956","Raymondville, TX",4,"Everyday use. I love using liquid pens for top eyeliner use rather than a pencil."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Jess","Houston-TX",5,"Easy to apply. Looks smooth. I've recently been a fan of gel liners but this one has them beat"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-ball-point?productId=xlsImpprod14321045","Cece","Chicago IL",1,"It's like if it doesn't have any ink to do the line. It doesn't paint black it's like grey fading I hate it!"
