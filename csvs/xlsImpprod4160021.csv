I just needed an extra pair of tweezers to pluck the stray hairs I see when getting ready.  I was able to purchase these in a cherry blossom print (my favorite).  They are perfect for what I need.  I also love that they come in a case that I feel is perfect for traveling."

The only negative is that I had to squeeze a little harder (metal is stiffer &amp; I suffer from arthritis in my hand) than another mini tweezer I have been using for a long time(can't remember the brand though - sorry)."

Revlon Mini Tweezer Set To Go contains a slant and point tip tweezer in a convenient pouch for all of your tweezing needs. Just that I don't use the point tip at all... still keep in for probable a splint? who knows."

"http://www.ulta.com/mini-tweezer-set-go?productId=xlsImpprod4160021","rexie","los angeles, ca",5,"Finally!! I've found a pair of tweezers that are not only perfect for my tiny toiletry bag but I've found a set that comes with 2 pairs and a cover. Yes!! The tips are sharp and have never let me down when it comes to plucking those stubborn stray eye brown hairs. They've even come in handy when my husband asked me to pluck out a tiny, stubborn, little ingrown hair that he'd had on his leg. My hands are fairly small, so these lil guys aren't too tiny for me. But, they may be too small for other folks. I think these are also perfect to keep in your first aid kit, especially the type that you'd send your kids to school with at the beginning of the year, or even for inside the trunk of your car. My Mom has borrowed them a few times to fix some of her clasps, on various jewelry pieces. They really come in handy."

"http://www.ulta.com/mini-tweezer-set-go?productId=xlsImpprod4160021","Tricia","Chicago, Illinois",5,"I've been getting my eyebrows threaded every 2 weeks for the last two years, and since I lost my job, I had to stop going to the salon to get my eyebrows done. I bought these for the price and the great reviews I read, AND IT WORKS WONDERFULLY! I love that the tweezers are small &amp; comes with a little pouch, so I can take it everywhere! Even if I did have enough money to get my eyebrows done again, I don't think I would because I've grown to love plucking my own eyebrows with these. Super easy to use &amp; doesn't frustrate me like other tweezers that become too dull. These gets every single hair, from fine, to even the annoying little stubbles."
