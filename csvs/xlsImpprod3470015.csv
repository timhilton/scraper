Super easy to travel with or throw in your purse. I like to check out my skin close up after my showers and it suction cups right to my big mirror under good lighting. Good buy, I'm happy.<br />=)"
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Tabba","Wilmington, DE",4,"This magnifying mirror does work. I find it magnifies a little too much for use with liquid eye liner, but it's great for plucking my eyebrows!"
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Bevy","Sacramento",5,"I use this mirror at home on my medicine cabinet mirror, lower right corner.; and I take it with me when I travel.  I have very light eyebrows and facial hair.  This allows me to see close up and pluck stray eyebrows or wild hair.  Also helpful if I have an acne breakout, I can actually see what I'm dealing with."

"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Laurielou","North Texas",5,"one of my best beauty buys. I love that I can actually see DETAILS up close. I stick this on the bathroom mirror &amp; use it to tweeze or put on eyeliner &amp; eyemakeup. It is made well &amp; lasts a long time. It was so usefull that I would take it off the mirror for travel &amp; wore out the little suction cup feet. Now that one stays in my makeup bag &amp; the got a replacement for the bathroom. The first one I've had for more than 5 years, I've dropped it several times on hard tile floors and although some bits of plastic broke off around the edges, the mirror has never broken."

It is perfect to see all those little stray hairs that you cannot normally see. I owned a mirror like this from a different company, and when I received this mirror I was shocked to see how much better this one worked, and how much clearer and up close I could see. I would definitely recommend this product."

"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Mairwen","Philadelphia area, PA",5,"Suction cups hold the mirror in place securely. No distortion. Only as big as I needed. Exactly what I needed for tweezing at a reasonable price."
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Bee","Florida",5,"Desperately needed a mag mirror I could pack when I travel. This works as a hand held or sticks to a slick surface (hotel mirror) for hands free. So far so good. This would make an excellent gift!"
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","S13phanie","Michigan",3,"Wished it were a little bigger so I can see more of my face."
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Leopard Jan","Macedonia, OH",5,"I use this mirror for just about anything to get a better look-specks in eye, tweezing,curling lashes, etc. The 10x magnification is the best, anything more than that starts to distort the image."
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Leopard Jan","Macedonia, OH",5,"I use this mirror when applying concealer and eye makeup.  The 10X magnification is perfect. Anything more powerful and there is distortion if it's not held very close to face."

"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","Q","Tennessee",5,"Perfect for close up work like plucking eyebrows or other unwanted facial hair.  Fits easily on current mirror.  Suction cups seem to work well - other similar product don't stick as well."

So helpful, I got 2 more. One for my make up case and one for my friend. This product is lightweight making it easy to pack for travel."

"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","PThom726","Columbia, SC",2,"I've gone through several of the little travel sized magnifying mirrors, over the last decade....most were heavy, easily dropped and broken. This one is lightweight, but the reflection is only true in dead center. I find I have to move it around quite a bit to be able to see my lashes well during mascara application.  This one will definitely go into my travel bag....I want something more accurate for everyday."
"http://www.ulta.com/magnifeye-10x-magnifying-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3470015","dr plee","Oakton, VA",4,"This is great for applying eye cream or eye makeup!  It sticks to your big mirror so I doesn't take up any space."
