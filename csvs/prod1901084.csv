This one doesn't feel like it gets all my eye lashes and I don't see them curled even when I use my mascara. But, not giving up on it ... it's different from those I've used in the past."

"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","em.","Clayton, NC",1,"I had left my makeup when I was out of town so I was stocking up on a few things to get me by. I purchased this eyelash curler because it was the cheaper of the choices. Since I already had my ride or die eyelash curler at home I was just looking for something to get me by. Nope. Curled my lashes but did not hold them. Squeaked. But the fact it did not create a curl for my lashes that held longer than 3 seconds is what turned me off."
"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","beaut","Fairview, PA",1,"I didn't want to spend a ton on an eyelash curler since I don't curl my eyelashes on an everyday basis. This one was very reasonable in price, looked alright in quality, and came from a drugstore brand I happen to like. In the end this eyelash curler was a waste of money. I didn't experience any pinching but it also didn't curl my eyelashes. I had to press very hard and kind of pump the tool to achieve anything at all which doesn't seem too healthy for my eyelashes."

I have very straight, stubborn lashes and this product did lift them, but not noticeably. Also, the curl falls quickly after you release your eyelashes and you have to squeeze very hard to make them close completely."

"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","Brenda","El Paso, TX",1,"I should have known not to buy this product as I've had issues with Revlon curlers before. However, I needed something that was inexpensive. Right out of the box, the rubber parts that cover the finger holes came off. The worst part is that the curler doesn't curl effectively. It doesn't grab all the lashes and it bends them, it doesn't curl them. I will never buy Revlon brand curlers again."
"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","Notanengineerbut","Philadelphia, PA",1,"This curler, along with MANY others available now have a DESIGN FLAW that keeps them from curling lashes properly.  The black rubber insert is &quot;humped&quot; or convex.  When the metal part comes down on it when you squeeze the curler, it forces the lashes into an un-natural downward angle around the &quot;hump&quot;.  Duh!  Pretty obvious there was no product testing and no engineering knowledge and now they are everywhere.  For an eyelash curler to work properly, the black rubber insert needs to be either flat or concave to force the lashes down and then up as the curler is squeezed.  Really simple here - why was this changed?  Dumb Dumb Dumb.  Eyelash curlers used to work fine."

So I settled on just buying a new one that included replacement pads. Not only are the finger grips really awkwardly placed, but these did not curl my lashes whatsoever. I feel like I had to apply extra pressure just to see a slight difference and it was uncomfortable."

I have lashes straighter than a needle, I have always used cheap priced curlers and never had a problem when it comes to getting the perfect curling results. I just don't seem to get the hang of this one. It doesn't work, I have to try many times to get a perfect curl. It's very poor quality for the name brand."

"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","Single mom trying to stay fly","Grapevine Texas",4,"I got this curler and was afraid that because of the great price it would be poor quality. But it has been durable and can handle living in my purse which can be a bit of a black hole. But I like to carry it with me everywhere I go so I can give my eyes a lift whenever I like. I like that the plastic insert stays and does not fall like with other curlers I have bought. I am very happy with my curler"

Since I've always used a very basic eyelash curler I thought that this one would work even better because of the design. I was wrong. First of all the design is hard to handle. Once I actually have a good grip on the eyelash curler and try to use it, I can't even get a good grip on my eyelash. And when I squeeze the handles to curl the lash, the grips start sliding off of the handles!! It's so bad that I have almost poked my eyeball with this eyelash curler at least twice!  I have been using other eyelash curlers for 20+ years with out these problems. I am returning this product ASAP!"

"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","Alicia","Indiana,PA",3,"I never bothered to use an eyelash curler before, so thought I'd pick one up.<br />After seeing how expensive bigger brands are (which is pretty ridiculous,btw;can't imagine better ones even cost too much too make), I picked this one up.<br />It's ok. It gets the job done, but not without pressing down pretty hard and pushing the curler handle upwards a little. <br />It is also very large for my eyes,yet with my face shape (prominent cheeks) and the shape of the curler, it puts the curler too far from my lashes, making it a bit more problematic. It's very hard to angle correctly, and I still have to go back in a second time to get the remaining lashes because it's just so far away from my lids that it can't reach all the lashes at once. Very weird. <br />I like the way my lashes look after I get the curl, but I wouldn't use this if I were trying to conserve time. <br />I wouldn't purchase again. Guess I'll try a $20 one and cross my fingers that it's better."

"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","Lethe","Phoenix, AZ",1,"When I got this out of the packaging, I could see ... something wasn't right. The thing is warped - one rod is longer than the other so it doesn't line up properly.<br /><br />It feels and sounds flimsy (I had another one in the past, but couldn't find it, so I nabbed this one - bad idea!), and as another reviewer mentioned, I have fears of clamping my flesh with it. It's shaped such that I'm not able to get a decent grip on my lashes, either - it's like the curve is too broad for my eye, so I'm only able to curl half the lashes on one eye at a time.<br /><br />Since I'd rather not lose my eyelid, I'm looking for a replacement. Maybe one that can get all my lashes without trying to pop my eye out."

"http://www.ulta.com/eyelash-curler?productId=prod1901084","Zapper","Minneapolis, MN",1,"They changed the quality and I feel that note their product is garbage and actually hurt to use. I've been loyal to this brand for years but now will never use again. I tried a few others at this price and they all now are hard so my recommendation is to spend more and get a quality product that is soft and feels good to use. Do not buy!"

I love this eyelashes curler because it doesn't pull out my eyelashes like others have. It does take a few tries for them to curl. Other than that, I would buy again and for now this is my fave."

It doesn't have enough... spring, i guess. it doesn't clamp hard enough on your eyelashes and it doesn't really even create curl. The design is good, it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, but it's not even as good as my elf eyelash curler, which was only a dollar. I wouldn't buy this again"
