"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Sue","Choctaw, Oklahoma",2,"I bought the Revelon brand name lighted makeup mirror because I have used that brand named mirror for the last 18 years and have absolutely loved the bright light that it had.  I bought a new light bulb for it when the light finally quit working, but that didn't fix it, so I set out to buy another one.   However the Revlon touch mirror I just purchased is so dim, even on high that I can't even really tell the light is on at all.  And every time I touch it, it either turns the light off or dims it even more.  Very disappointed!  I feel like I've had the very best mirror light in the past, that's why I bought Revelon brand name again without even doing any research.  Needless to say, I'm very disappointed with my purchase!  Will do my homework and research next time......shame on me!!!!!"

"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Frankie","Quakertown, PA",2,"Like other reviews said, it is a very dim light on the brightest setting. I have to use another light to actually see the makeup I'm applying. Is it that hard to use brighter bulbs?? I also don't know if I like the touch base (to turn the light on). I put my makeup around the base and constantly touch it by accident and the light will turn off. I waited a long time to get a mirror like this only to be disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because the mirror used in bright daylight works very well... maybe I'm being too nice."

"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Betty","Santa Clarita",3,"Although this has three light settings, none of them are very bright. Even the brightest one seems dim to me. I never use the other two. The selling point for me was the indoor/outdoor lighting options, so I'm a bit disappointed that the lighting is mediocre on this mirror."
"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Katiecakes","CT",1,"I will be returning this mirror. It doesn't have enough light and a slight touch of the base turns it off."

"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Mish","Bridgewater, MA",1,"This is going back. The light is useless. Also, can you tell me the logic of sticking TWO stickers on the mirror that do NOT come off easily. I am disappointed to say the least. NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Cindi","York, PA",1,"I returned the product because the light was not bright enough and the touch control was so sensitive that I kept turning the light off while doing my makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","mrs gracey","pontiac me",2,"Not impressed with this mirror. It has three different light settings, and still not bright enough you still need extra lighting. The touch feature is too sensitive."

"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Barbara","Tallahassee, FL",4,"Love the product!  One thing:  While I love the touch feature and how the lighting gets stronger with each touch, there is only one setting in terms of type of light, which seems to be more of an evening setting."
"http://www.ulta.com/perfect-touch-lighted-oval-mirror?productId=xlsImpprod3310043","Caitlin","NC",2,"I use this product every morning when I am getting ready. I really like that mirror part; it's clear and the magnification side is great. I wish the mirrow was a round shape instead of oval. I couldn't tell by the box. The thing I literally hate about this product is that the base is activated by touch. It turns off if anything touches it, such as a face wipe or the sleeve to my robe. It's very frustrating, and I will never purchase anything like this again."

The main purpose of buying a lighted makeup mirror is to have adequate LIGHTING. Do not waste your money. I have an old school conair that has brighter lighting even on it's darkest setting. I just bought this tonight and will be returning it for a different one ASAP."

It was wasn't bright enough. I didn't ever use the magnification side so I can't speak to it. All magnification mirrors seem distorted to me. I did like the adjustibility of the mirror"

Others mention the touch on/off being too sensitive (which almost kept me from buying this mirror).  I really haven't had this problem.

The lighting should just not be called a light. If you are looking for function excluding light then this is a pretty mirror. I purchased for the light as well. I will be returning to the store."

I have been looking for a new lighted make up mirror and this was one of the only ones left in Ulta so I got it. I got home and was excited to plug it in. The touch command worked at first. I turned it off and went to turn it on again like 10 minutes later and it would not come on. The next day I check it again and it comes on, but I go to the store anyway to try to find bulbs just in case. I take the mirror lid off and can't get it back on. I am so mad and disappointed in this. I am returning and ordering one with great ratings!"

Revlon, how do you get away with selling this as a lighted makeup mirror?  The highest, brightest setting is the equivalent of putting on your makeup with one tea light candle.  If you don't mind a dim tea light candle, save your money and just use a candle to apply your makeup.  The mirror was distorted and gave me a headache to look into it on both sides.  I'm going to  go back to my Bino NON-LIGHTED makeup mirror and just use a lamp and 75 watt light bulb with no lamp shade.  What a waste of time and money.  I had to drive a long distance to get this, too.  So frustrated."

It is rather small and the light is not as bright as I'd hoped since the area where I use it is not well lit.

The only one that helps is the highest one unless you're already in a well light room.. When it gets hot you can feel the warmth on your face and if you try to flip the mirror it feels super hot! The touch turn on is quick and easy, but that means it's also very easy to accidently turn off constantly. The cord is nice and long, too."

The outer structure is made of chrome in a satin finish and has three setting for light intensity, low, medium, and high. It goes on with a touch to the base. The mirror is sturdy and well made. My only problem with this mirror is the intensity of the lighting, or rather, lack of. I wanted a mirror with similar lighting intensity to a Clairol trifold mirror I had as a teen, which lit with fluorescent tubes. I like to use intense lighting when applying my makeup because if it looks good in intense light it'll look good in any lighting. So, yeah, I was disappointed by this feature I would term as a flaw because the mirror looks really stylish and beautiful and I was looking forward to including it in my dressing table set up. I did return it to Ulta with my receipt and was immediately refunded my money's without any problem. Big plus for Ulta there. I made sure the mirror was repackaged as it was when I purchased it as well. Some people don't want super bright lighting but I actually require it from any lighted mirror I have.
