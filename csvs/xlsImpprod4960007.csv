Makes my uneven skin tone good, covers up acne scars. It smells like sunscreen but it quickly went away.. Kind of shiny so I set with powder.. Overall it's a great product"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-bb-cream-skin-perfector-spf-30?productId=xlsImpprod4960007","TKB","Naperville, IL",5,"This is the best BB Cream I have tried. I have very sensative skin, and I have had no issues at all. It is 30SPF Which makes it wonderful for everyday use. I use it alone for daytime and under my make-up at night."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-bb-cream-skin-perfector-spf-30?productId=xlsImpprod4960007","Jojo","Seattle",2,"I have normal-to-dry skin and while I like the color and coverage this product provides, the texture is a little too drying for my skin. First, it sets really quickly, so it becomes tacky once you start rubbing it in. Second, once it does become a little drier, it starts &quot;pilling&quot; on me, if that makes sense. As I keep rubbing to blend it in, little flakes of the product start forming, kind of like when you rub glue between your hands. Also, the smell is a little off-putting. Overall I probably would recommend this for people who don't have as dry skin, but the coverage is great for everyday use when you don't have anything too heavy."

But, for what I paid for this product, it wasnt worth the hype. I mean, it's good and I use it, and I will use it much more during the summer, but for purposes such as school and sports, it's not useful. Im switching back to my Loreal BB Cream until summer roles around. Again, not a bad product at all, but I expected way better than what I got."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-bb-cream-skin-perfector-spf-30?productId=xlsImpprod4960007","Jules","Colorado",4,"From what I have heard, this BB cream is not good for ALL skin conditions (especially naturally oily skin). For my incredibly dry skin, however, this product is perfect! It causes breakouts occasionally, but I already get acne regularly, so that's really not a huge deal to me. The coverage could be better, but for a basic, everyday BB cream, Revlon PhotoReady does a fantastic job! Other BB creams I have tried have looked fine in person, but made my skin look awful and weird on camera. If you are planning on having pictures taken of yourself, this is the BB cream to wear. It also blends super well and even though it only comes in a few shades, the lightest shade fits my SUPER light skin very well, which is often hard for me to find in BB creams."

I tried it after I bought it and it was decent, but within the first week after I bought this, the product separated into a disgusting, chunky, oily mess. I never left it in a hot car, it was stored in my (air conditioned) bathroom. I only got to use it once before it curdled. The one time I did get to use it it was okay but not great for the price."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-bb-cream-skin-perfector-spf-30?productId=xlsImpprod4960007","Shar","Atlanta, GA",1,"I bought this after hearing a lot of people rave about how great it was (long lasting great coverage yet lightweight and natural feeling). However it seemed to miss the mark, especially for its high price for a drugstore brand. The color was not light enough and the formula left it feeling a little bit greasy on the skin. It's definitely a shame since I am willing to spend the money on good products, which Revlon seems to have, but not this one."

This immediately feels greasy on my face. I did try setting it with powder and it did not work. It makes my skin look worse than before I put it on.

Although it's a nightmare getting on. It always looks streaky and is hard to blend. I would recommend this for a 1-4 hours in room temperature. If you're gonna be in the heat it sweats off FAST. The only reason I gave it stars is it gives good coverage and moisture."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-bb-cream-skin-perfector-spf-30?productId=xlsImpprod4960007","Gigi","Nj",3,"This best described as a tinted moisturizer or better yet a tinted sunscreen... Literally because it has that sunscreen feel and smell. I have normal to dry skin. Now that its winter my skin is dryer than ever so that's why I gave it 3 stars because I don't  necessarily like it but I don't hate it either. From the bottom of heart I do not suggest someone to use who has oily combination skin because it would look like you put oil on your Face. Me like I said I have dry skin and it makes me look shiny. It feels like I put two layers of moisturizer on. Th coverage is very sheer, doesn't cover redness or acne. When i applied this to my face it made me shiny and it kinda made my face look like I have a fake tan . I dont know if that made sense but I choose the color medium because that what my shade usually is and it actually made me look darker . Idk bottom line Is I like the SPF and moisterizing effect because its soooo cold but i guess theres soooo much spf and the effects of it there's not much to like about it."

I do put this over my Anastasia concealer and it does so well with coverage. I blend it out with my Miracle Sponge and it just goes on pretty well. I admit that at first squeeze, it looks disappointing, but it turned out to be one of my favorite BB creams. I'm wearing it right now and it's still holding up nicely. It leaves me smooth and hydrated. I really love this BB cream for days where I just wanna go natural."

Unfortunately, this is a bad product. It did not blend at all. I made several attempts to use it sparingly, use it liberally, mix it in with my moisturizer, etc., the results were always the same: it sits on the skin in watches, like nude cottage cheese. You really have to rub it in to blend it. My skin tone is medium/olive, but even the light/medium color came in a hue that was too orange. Very disappointed."

I tried illuminating one and normal formula. I wasn't wowed by either. It left me feeling swallowed up by a heavy sunscreen. So I tried out this Revlon BB and the Nyx BB. I really loved this product more than I expected. My skin is fair, patchy, dry. I have large pores, hyperpigmentation, black heads on nose and chin area. This is very sheer, but somehow it made me look &quot;put together.&quot; It has a nice glow to it. I would suggest only those with dry skin try this out. Also those with dry skin check out the NYX BB. Overall, I really like the Revlon BB and will continue using it until I see any cons or downsides. It's great for something light and easy to apply. (I used my fingers to apply it and I am NOT someone who likes to apply makeup with my fingers)"

It was streaky with a brush, not good with a beauty blender, with fingers it was best but not buildable enough and did not look right. I like that the medium was not light or too dark but something just seemed off. I looked sickly when ever I used this. Maybe it is too olive toned???<br />It wore off pretty quick also and accentuated pores. <br />The only thing I liked about it was the texture on my skin. It was not too heavy or greasy. Once set with powder it felt nice and I did not get oily!! Woohoo BUT I looked a mess lol. <br />I looked sick, Looked like I had no coverage for the marks on my skin which are light by the way.

This one wasn't too expensive, so I thought I'd give it a try. <br /><br />It wasn't especially moisturizing, so I can't really skip my regular moisturizer, which I was hoping to do. It spreads more like a liquid foundation, not like a moisturizer.<br /><br />The coverage isn't anything to write home about, either. I usually skip foundation entirely, so I wasn't too upset about that, but it doesn't seem to be smoothing my tone or anything.<br /><br />The biggest 'pro' is that it hasn't made my skin break out like normal liquid foundations do. It's very lightweight, which is a plus. And I like having something with SPF.<br /><br />Overall, though, I don't see this one as being the 'miracle cream' BBs seem to want to be."

So I am seeking a BB cream for the warmer months and decided to pick this up.<br /><br />People expecting BB creams to have the coverage of foundations will always be disappointed. But I do feel this is lighter coverage even than other BB creams I have enjoyed. That said, the light coverage on this product does help even out skin tone for me, enough for a casual knock-around day where I don't want full makeup. Using it as a base underneath light liquid or mineral makeups works really well. <br /><br />I did not experience the greasiness others complain about, but I wonder if they use BB creams with SPF in them normally? Because anything with SPF will be a little bit &quot;stickier&quot; than ones without. Also expired product, product kept in hotter conditions, etc will tend to separate and the oils will be more prominent in that case. <br /><br />I want to reserve full judgement until I have word this for more than a few days, to see how my skin fares. But for now, enjoying this drug store find!"

I just didn't love it. I'm not sure what I was expecting but to me it just felt like a tinted moisturizer rather than a BB cream."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-bb-cream-skin-perfector-spf-30?productId=xlsImpprod4960007","CeeBeauty","Oceanside",3,"The only down fall with this product is that by mid day your face will def be on the oily side, even during winter season. I found that using a matte powder helps or just blotting your face with a napkin. The coverage is sheer, if you need to conceal any redness, add concealer on top of it..A powder to finish is definitly needed!<br />OVERALL- good, on the go- just make sure to check mid-day for shiny face."

I always bought Almay but decided to give my favorite brand,  Revlon,  a try.  I absolutely hate the way this BB creams smells! It is such a potent scent- the product is actually very oily too,  probably more for dry skin rather than oily/combination.  I've found good use for it when I want to skip a primer and use the BB cream as one,  but I wouldn't buy this again,  simply because the scent and oiliness of it doesn't agree with my skin."

The product goes on nicely, is smooth and has a higher SPF (30).  My one main issue is that it either doesn't have the coverage of BB's I've tried or it doesn't last on the skin.  I'm still on the fence with it but will try setting it with powder to see if that lasts longer.  All in all, not bad for a lower end BB cream and no irritation"
