"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Jules","New Baltimore, MI",4,"I liked it because i wasn't sure about the coral color, but after initially putting it on a few minutes later, darkened and pinked up on my lips and looked really good.  Glad i bought it."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Porcelain Pale","Minnesota",4,"It was nice to finally find a stain that didn't completely dry out my lips. I like that this stain has a bit of shine to it when applied, not completely matte. If you wipe off the excess after a while, the actual stain of the balm isn't quite as dark as I'd like, but the balm and stained color does stay on pretty well. I'm a big coffee drinker and I don't have to reapply after a cup, which is nice. I'd recommend this if you're looking for a pop of color, but don't want to have to reapply all the time, like some other lip products require."

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Tes the &quot;Pale Princess&quot;","Richmond, VA",4,"The sweetheart shade is VERY pigmented and long lasting. Even after the &quot;balm&quot; wears off the stain remains ALL day. On days when I want something more natural, I apply the balm and wait a minute before wiping it away with a tissue- leaving a natural stain. <br />The romantic shade is more of a &quot;sheer red.&quot; I love it because it adds a reddish tint to my lips without wearing a bold/intense red lip. However, it isn't as long lasting as the sweetheart shade so I have to reapply it every few hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Fuschiadiva","Houston, TX",5,"I've been looking for a lip product that has a bit of a staining effect so it's still there even when it's wearing off, and this is the one. I really like the easy application and the color is perfect for providing just a hint of color without looking too bold."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Blondie","NJ",5,"I wear this sheer lip stain daily. It's natural looking,  plus protects and treats your lips simultaneously. I keep one in my desk, purse, car, and  I have about six back ups at home. My color seems to be popular so I have to scoop them up when I can find them."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Grammy","Camillus, NY",5,"I use a lip liner in the same shade just to give my lips more definition, and this works very well.  I don't think you'll be disappointed at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","G","Amarillo, TX",4,"I bought this in both romantic and crush. Both colors look really pretty on. The romantic is more of a watermelon red colored and the crush is a darker berry color, even after it has dried to just stain. It doesn't dry out my lips and lasts almost all day. The color is buildable so if I just want a little color I only go over my lips once and if I want more I go over my lips twice or three times."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","sharon","New Hyde Park",5,"It glides on smoothly, has a nice natural tint and precise application because of the crayon like shape. It smells minty too!"

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Erin","Port Huron, MI",5,"This specific color in Honey is my go-to lip color. I've gone through multiple tubes of this stain! I love the easy of application and the gorgous color IT stains my lips. Only thing is that the color isn't really close to the packaging. I find it to be darker and less neutral then you would expect. But I still love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Cailin","Orange County, CA",4,"I have it in Romantic and it's okay!! It smells good and stuff. Its just more coral toned than I expected. (and its not like SUPER coral toned just a little!) But if thats what youre going for (a subtle, orangey pink) then this product is rockin! lol. not bad stuff :) hoping to try other colors!"
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Tammy","Brentwood",5,"Great for everyday wear. Perfect for those days when I am running errands and want a natural yet put together look.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a stand-out lip color or a glossy lip color. Like I said, perfect for a long-lasting hint of color."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Kitty","NM",5,"For the price, I think this product is phenomenal! The color is beautiful, is not tacky or sticky at all which is a huge plus, and it really lasts. You can eat and drink and you won't have the glossy finish but you still have a wonderful hint of color."

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Kendra","Fargo, ND",4,"I really like this product a lot!!! It is great for everywhere I go because they are soft colors making it not to flashy. First, make sure to put chap stick on before hand, even if you don't have dry lips. Not only does it make it easier when applying it also makes it stay longer! It has a glossy finish but its not overwhelming. I am definitely buying more of these!"
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Kelley","Grand Haven, MI",5,"I have such a hard time finding lipstick that I can wear at work that will last. I bought Charm and Rendez-vous. Charm for more subtle pink colour and Rendez-vous for a pop of redish orange. I find that the application is better if worn over a moisturising lip balm. I find that it locks in the moisture too and it goes on smoother. But it lasts for hours, even through drinking and eating. So that's why I love it so much."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","lookin good","Ogden, Utah",5,"I apply this stain generously and the color is perfect, as the time goes on the color of the stain looks like a natural pinkish lip color - I keep several around in my makeup kit, purse, coat pockets etc!"

The color does not last on me at all, and I found them to be super drying.  Back to the drawing board for me!"
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","TKO rose","tx",1,"Love the matte version of this product but the lip stain version is not what I expected from a lip stain. The colors are not saturated enough to show up on my lips and they never soaked in and stained my lips like other stains that I've used. Don't bother."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","MagTheHen","Grant, Michigan",3,"I used a lip liner, then applied the product.

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Henna McBollywood","Pittsburgh, PA",3,"This is a pretty good product. It's moisturizing with a nice minty flavor, which is a huge plus. The color, however, doesn't show that easily. You need to layer it up. The only issue I had with this was feathering. This is the first time it's happening to me with a lip product."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Karolina","La Puente, CA",4,"I add it to my lips to give them a nice color. If your lips are dry it can flake, but it can help with dry lips if you don't have lip balm, but if you do you should add lip balm before you apply it on. Otherwise it's great and I like it."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Fitness chick","Salt Lake City, UT",4,"The more you layer on the more color shows up on your lips. I like it, would try more colors. Easy to mix with other lipsticks for new colors. A tad drying. Doesn't last as long as I'd hoped. But if you keep adding chap-stick to it. It looks smoother, and will last longer."

I want one in every shade. The stain part is great and doesn't look unnatural at all which was my concern with the stain. It lasts a few hours at work which is nice."

I researched the type of lip color that is used on the TV show Scandal and came across this suggestion and let me tell you this lip balm stain is phenomenal. The color I bought is Honey and it's gorgeous. It gives just the right amount of color without being overpowering. I still use my cocoa butter stick and I put the Revlon on top and it lasts ALL DAY and even into the next morning. And this is even after brushing my teeth at night. I don't wear any makeup or anything so this is perfect for the natural girls like myself. Go get it!"

My only issue with the product is that it isn't exactly the color it purports to be. Honey was darker than I expected, but Rendezvous and Adore are fabulous."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","29 Again","New Jersey",5,"Like this product, would tell my friends and family about it."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Kait","Virginia",5,"Haven't used another lipstick or lip color since I stumbled on these! I have 6 shades: Cherish, Darling, Honey, Charm, Rendezvous, and Precious, but don't plan on buying the others because dark/deep lip colors don't look good against my blue eyes, fair freckly skin and blonde hair. I use these whenever I leave my house and even sometimes when I don't. They're so moisturizing and glide on like a lip balm; I forget that I'm even wearing them! The tingling and minty scent dissipate about 3 minutes after application so if you don't like that in a lip product, don't let it deter you from these! The color stays on all day (and sometimes all night!) but when it does fade, it doesn't get splotchy or fade faster in some places than others. They're glossy right after application, but the glossiness wears away and becomes matte when your lips are completely stained (1-2 hours after). The color stays completely even and has never dried out my lips, unlike other lip stains I've tried in the past. If you do find them to be a little drying, you could always put a little gloss or lip balm over it throughout the day. Out of the ones I have, all are &quot;true to tube color&quot; but some fade to lighter colors than they were initially after about 6-7 hours of wear. The product itself (especially Honey) looks a lot darker than the tube, but it doesn't go on that dark."

As the red does not &quot;stain&quot; as it should. I wake up to a very soft pink and pouty lips every morning. It's GREAT!"

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Lesleyb","San Francisco",3,"I was a big fan of the Just Bitten lip stain. You put it on and it changed your lip color for hours and you could put any moisturizer or lip balm over it. This is not the same thing. It is a pencil that is more moisturizing but stains only slightly.  It's a decent lipstick but not a stain."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Geri","Pekin, IL",5,"Love the way it goes on and the color stays longer than most I have tried!"
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Design Lady","Memphis",5,"Despite the surprising staying power, this is SO much easier to apply than the long-wearing wand lipsticks. Feels creamy and doesn't have a horrible fruity smell that makes you feel like you've accidentally used your child's toy lip gloss. I use Honey, which is very nice, but wish there were a few more color choices."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Lizfogle09","Los Angeles, CA",5,"Saw this product recommended on a YouTube makeup video so I had to try it. The color is use is Hiney. It is a natural pink tone that stains the lip. So when the gloss wears off you still have a very natural color to your lips. No drying or cracking. Went for a facial recently and my esthetician wanted to know how my lips were such a pretty color after she had finished cleaning my face. I also love that you just twist it to get more product. No pencil sharpener required."

Creamy but not gooey and shiney. The color darkens a bit after you put it on. Only wish there were more colors to choose from. I think I have them all!"

I chose a pale pink and when I tried it on for the first time, my daughter said it looked like I had &quot;Barbie&quot; lips. I returned it."

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Mikii","Des Moines, IA",5,"I bought this in Smitten and its such a cute color. I may just buy some other shades as well depending on how long the color stays. I prefer the balm to the lipstain because it moisturizes instead of dries like stain does for me. The color is bold but not too crazy! Very easy to apply and you can choose how pigmented you'd like by applying it over a few times. I definitely think if you're skeptic, just try it, I bet you'll like it. Also, its not sticky, but its not smooth.. its pretty neutral in feeling, and it has a little gloss look to it."

It has a light peppermint smell that I adore. The only fault I have with it is that it wears off pretty easily, and the stain underneath is bright coral. I love corals to death, but when I'm doing a look that needs a nude lip, it'd be nice for it to stay a nude. Just a couple touch-ups a day though, is fine with me for the moisturizing gorgeous color."

In the past, I've used the lip stains that are basically shocking pink in color and that peel off--this stain is in pencil form, goes on smoothly, and lasts quite a long time. It also comes in attractive colors. It doesn't dry out my lips. I am very happy that I found this!"

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","e","OR",4,"Honestly my favorite lip product - I'll never be able to go back to any other, simply because I've become spoiled on not having to worry about touching up throughout the day.  It isn't particularly hydrating, but I usually wear regular lip balm underneath anyway.<br />Honey: I use this color pretty much everyday. &quot;My lips but better&quot; pink, though when it gets to the &quot;stain&quot; part, it becomes brighter and more noticeable than when you first apply.  If you want a true nude that stays nude, go with Charm.  I touch up Honey about once or twice a day, because it tends to fade unevenly, highlighting any weird lines or dry spots on lips.<br />Rendezvous: Red, but a bright red rather than a deep one.  Goes on more matte than Honey, but I think as you build it up, it becomes glossier. This has amazing staying power.  If I put it on before a night out, my lips will still be pleasantly red (but very natural-looking!) the morning after.  It fades evenly and I almost never have to touch up.<br />Honey seems to be more glossy than Rendezvous, but I think that's just because I've used it more often.  As the point of the crayon goes down, the product becomes &quot;slicker&quot; and less matte on the lips.<br />It does have a faint minty smell, which I know some people hate, and it's not as sweet as some minty lip balms - smells a little mediciney or floss-like, to be honest.  But it's really not that noticeable.<br />If you're on the fence about springing for this product, I'd say just go for it.  Everyone I know unanimously loves it!"

Instead, it's fresh and pretty and can bring a lot to a dark or neutral work look. It has a subtle minty taste that is not intrusive. It lasts well, but I wouldn't say it's truly an all-day stain. It's more like a balm that gives you some moisture, that lasts pretty well for a balm. One thing I don't love is that this &quot;pencil&quot; cannot be sharpened. Strange way to deliver this product, but it's lasted longer than I would have expected, and this will not keep me from buying it again. Recommended!"

If you like SUPER shiny lips you might want to add gloss but these carry the perfect amount of shine for me. I do want to mention that the matte line is VERY DRYING. Revlon did an amazing job with the color choices and pay off. The color is pretty lasting, some more than others. I personally have gone thry at least 3 of Honey (my go to every day lip)."

I bought Romantic (which shows up as a dark orange-y red on me) and Cherish (a nice true pink). After checking on it three hours later, the color is still there, just much brighter. There's a minty smell that goes away pretty quickly and I didn't notice it drying my lips out at all. I'm pleased!"

I was happy that the color of the tube was very similar to the color of the product.<br />Previously I had purchased a balm stick by another brand.  The tube was nothing like the color of the product.  <br />This product does have more staying power than your typical balm, however, it does tend to settle into those winter lines and cracks after awhile.  <br />In my experience it is not as moisturizing as they would have you believe, however, it certainly will not deter me from buying other shades.<br />Overall this is a convenient product with a nice color range.   <br />I personally top it with Nivea Kiss of Lemon and Olive Oil lip balm for extra moisture and a hint of shine.<br />I think this is going to be a great product for spring and summer."

The colors go well with all skin colors except perhaps very dark skin colors, you may just consider using for a glossy balm as I don't know if the color intensity would be enough to show through.

Its a pretty pink color with a slight blue undertone and it looks good with my fair skin (I have red undertones).  The one thing I would suggest is to exfoliate your lips and apply a little lip balm, I noticed that on dryer lips, this clings to dry skin.  Plus its minty, my fave!"

I got this darker red shade after trying out the more orange shade Rendevous.  The red one seems a bit more drying on the lips, so look out if you have flaky, dry lips - the deep color really accentuates it, so make sure to exfoliate!  But the color, which applies sheer or you can keep layering for a darker color, really does stain and stays on all day.  i love to throw this on for a pop of color at work and I think this stick will last a long time, just because of the formula and how little you need to apply.  Get it!  It doesn't really have a scent, which I appreciate.  Packaging is pretty."

Now I can wear red lips again without my husband kissing it off! It's the perfect shade of red, too. The lip stains are moisturizing initially but can be drying after a few hours - so to remedy this - I simply put EOS on my lips before applying the lip stain. This method keeps my lips smooth and moist - and full of color for the entire day. I love it!"

Has a sweet light scent and taste (sweet mint?) but no tingling. Each color has it's benefits, but can take you to work to going out. Each application seems to stain the lips more &amp; more, slight but affective. Love the soft shine. Not true to packaging, but comes across as sheer, lighter lip balm that offers staining. No sharpener needed. Love this and I have in several colors. Not a big commitment, moisturizing lip balm."

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Meg","New York, NY",4,"I'm going to write a lengthy review about this product, just because it surprised me even though I'd done much research on it before purchasing.<br />I bought this in the shade Honey because I'd heard it was the most natural color of the line, and I love love love this product. <br /><br />It smells a bit like a candy cane, but the fragrance is not strong at all, not compared to other products like Tarte Lipsurgence and C.O. Bigelow lip glosses. You can smell it on the crayon, but not on your lips. <br /><br />Unfortunately, you don't get a lot of product; you get about an inch and a half, but I think it'll be fine because it's long-lasting and doesn't need to be reapplied often. The texture is so smooth, and the color payoff is pigmented, but not opaque. At first, your lips will have a hint of shine and WILL not be stained yet, so I advise you to put this balm stain on at least a half hour before you eat, drink, kiss, etc because it will come off like a normal lipstick. The staying power kicks in once the balm is gone and it feels like your lips are bare. Also, be SURE to exfoliate and moisturize your lips prior to using this. The worst thing you can do is apply this to chapped, flaky lips. My lips were slightly chapped, leaving unsightly bits of skin on the crayon. Don't be surprised if this is not extremely moisturizing. Buy it for the color, not the balm. It is, however, much easier on the lips than most lip stains, especially those marker stains. <br /><br />Don't judge a book by its cover. In other words, don't judge these babies by their packaging or even the color of the crayon stick. I noticed that the shade I bought, Honey, changes color over time. This might not apply to the other colors, but it did to this one. When I first put on the balm stain, the color appeared like the color of the crayon, only slightly more pink. When the balm faded, my lips were left with a different, even pinker, bright color. It looked like the color of the packaging of Sweetheart as shown on this website. I'm fine with bright colors so I was okay with it, but it was surprising because I thought it was supposed to be the most natural, universally flattering shade of the bunch, but here I was with a bright pink on my lips. I then reapplied the balm on my lips again, and a different color appeared, a berry pink. Later, it returned to the bright pink. If you're looking for a natural color, Honey is not your best bet, surprisingly.<br /><br />What I love about this product the most is how long and well it lasts. I went about my day normally, licking my lips, eating, talking, and the color stayed and was even. It wasn't 100 smudge-proof, but I was very satisfied. I wear this every day and plan on getting more colors in the future. Whoohoo!"

Not supper glossy, making it great for all ages, but does have a little shine making it look like you just applied a lip balm.I'm not one to use lip gloss or color because of the need to reapply so often. Since its a stain, the color lasts even when the shine is gone. Easy to use with a crayon like tip. Its not drying like other lip stains but its also not the best for moisturizing. <br /><br />The only issue I have when wearing this after a few hours the color seems darker in the lines on my lips.

Second, the color is more sheer and customizable. <br /><br />The only bad thing about this lip stain is the colors are a little unpredictable. I got &quot;sweetheart&quot;, and its REALLY pink. I then bought &quot;romantic&quot; and my absolute favorite &quot;adore&quot;. They're better colors, in my opinion.<br /><br />I like to wear it over chapstick for everyday sheer color.

The colors I own are honey, lovesick, and smitten, and I must say, they are quite beautiful, though the deeper colors are at times overpowering.  I personally like to apply smitten and then eat breakfast and get ready to wear off the balm part (there WILL be a stain left) and then apply honey for a beautiful look.  The only cons I can think of is that when the balm wears off, your lips feel weird AT FIRST but if you put on chapstick or reapply, then it goes away.  I also wish that the lighter colors would last as long as the dark colors, but hey, I'm happy!  I really hope that they add more colors!"

This is by far my favorite one- the color is beautiful, goes on smooth and even, and surprisingly long-lasting. <br /><br />It's definitely more of a stain than a balm since the tint lasts longer than the lip-balm feeling. I found that the color lasts for hours, fades evenly, and does not dry out my lips.<br /><br />I prefer a more natural look, so I selected 'Honey' which looked the least dramatic. I am very pleased with the &quot;natural but better&quot; pinkish color on my light/fair skin. It has a slight menthol smell during application, but that smell goes away after just a couple minutes.

So far I've had 2 friends purchase some after I raved about mine!  I don't recommend a couple of the lighter colors.

That said, I have tried numerous different lip/cheek stains but this one by far is the best. I love that it's in a chubby little stick and I don't have to use one of those nail polish type bottles where I have to blend the color in with my fingers [how annoying!]. I also like the subtle shine that goes along with this one...and while the sheen disappears over time, the color clings, wearing quite naturally.  I have light/medium skin, no wrinkles, freckles, I am 41 and I bought the Honey shade and love it.  I will definitely try some of the other colors as a result of trying this one! Be sure to exfoliate your lips prior to wearing this, you want a smooth surface upon which to apply it!"

It's not necessarily moisturizing but it is definitely not drying either.  I bought the color crush and it's a beautiful berry color that can be applied lightly for just a slight stain to the lips or it can be built up to a darker, bold lip. When I apply it, I roll the product directly to the center of my lips and then spread it out with a lip brush and it works lovely. The color is pretty long-lasting."

I have bought every lipstain on the market, and was unhappy with most of them. I was hesitant to purchase this one because I have used the stain from Revlon that was like a marker with the balm on the other end and hated it, it was blotchy and wore off quickly. I am so glad I gave this a shot the color stays all day at work even through lunch. I add a balm or gloss about half way through the day, but the color is still perfect not blotchy at all. I can't say enough good things about this. I will be buying most of the colors available. I love them."

I love the  finish of the balm stain in comparison to the laquer  and matte options. The look is moist with a healthy amount of color. There is a slightly minty smell to them at first. I don't mind that, but I was seeking moisture in choosing a balm, and sometimes minty things have ingredients that can be irritating for sensitive or dry lips. I didn't notice anything drying or irritating about the balm stain.<br /><br /> The tubes are kind of intimidating vibrant colors and at first I was not sure which would suit me; keep in mind the colors go on as sheer versions of what the tube looks like. So shades I wouldn't think I look good in work because they aren't super saturated. They also don't seem to stain at first, but they do. The color lasted longer than a standard tinted balm. I bought two (&quot;honey&quot; a soft neutral shade that would enhance anyones natural lip color- good for an everyday look and &quot;Adore&quot; which is a nice somewhat brown red that is pretty and not overwhelming) but if I was not limited by practicality, I may have gotten more."

The color selection is terrible to begin with but the ACTUAL color is nothing like the product packaging or even like the product itself when it's applied to your lips. There is no &quot;stain&quot; but just tinted balm. It wears off faster than most basic lipsticks so there is no &quot;ColorStay&quot; about it. And for nearly $10, this is a complete waste of money.

I bought adore, which is in theory a very lovely colour, but for some reason came out much less dark than I was expecting (the color of the actual crayon-y bit itself doesn't even speak true).

The worst part though is that after applying it (carefully and various times on different days in hopes that it might be better this time) the stain &quot;bleeds&quot; out from the edges of your lips, so it ended up looking like I was an idiot incapable of applying lipstick.  If you try this, just be warned that it STAINS and whatever color you put on, it or a shade thereof will be on you for several hours. (ex:  I applied it around 5 pm and even after washing my face and sleeping, it was still noticeable the next morning around 10am) I did like the &quot;balm&quot; part of it... it was definitely more moisturizing than any other lipstain product I've used before.  Still, no way will I wear this stuff again.  This stuff is going back."

So glad I did because I love the product!  It goes on glossy with a slight sheen to it and stays really well.  The initial gloss fades after a bit and then it stays as a stain on your lips.  It's so lightweight sometimes I feel like I'm not wearing anything then look in the mirror and the color still looks great.  Also it doesn't fade weird as I've noticed with other lipstains.  I also purchased this in Sweetheart and Cherish.  I like layering these with the Super Lustrous nude gloss as well which keeps the glossy look lasting longer."

It is the best my lips but better color to wear everyday or when I just don't want to think about what will look good, cause that one always looks good! The other day I bought &quot;Rendevous&quot; and I love that one just as much. I wanted an orange lip color but wasn't sure how it would look. This is a great first step and it looks great. It's not so in your face bold but it has just enough color. These have a pleasant minty smell that I like. They do wear off some when you eat but honestly they are so easy to re-apply, I don't even care. The packaging is great, easy to toss in my purse. I don't feel I need a mirror to reapply.

Every time I wear it I get compliments from random strangers. Not only is it (Sweetheart) a cheerful shade to see in the mirror before I leave the house, but it's a lift to receive so many compliments when I'm out. People say they love my lipstick, that the color is so pretty, that it looks great on me but they could never pull off that color, and sometimes the compliments extend to my hair and skin while they are at it. When I wear this color, I must become 10 times better looking, because I swear this never happens with any other lip color. Wear it and you'll be more beautiful too. I'm 60, so you don't have to be young for it to work its magic. <br /><br />I apply it in several layers, blotting in between, and it lasts all day. All I need is to add a bit of plain chapstick in the afternoon to keep my lips from getting dry."

Hands down one of the BEST drugstore balm stains by far!!! When you apply it, your lips are greeted by a very rich and buttery texture. The color (I got 050 Precious because I adore nude lip colors) is just the right tint on my lips. A little re-application may be needed throughout the day/night but it's a large lip product so I don't really mind that. My only complaint is that I didn't buy a second one. Good job Revlon!! I am very impressed and can't wait to try out the other colors. :D"

I usually find drugstore buys to be cheap in quality, but this stain was exactly what I've been looking for. It was easy to apply, stayed for 6+ hours through eating and drinking with little fading, and didn't transfer or smudge when I kissed my husband and white puppy a mere 60 seconds after applying it. Smitten is a beautiful blue-based hot pink (much lighter than the image would lead you to believe) that looks amazing, even on my super-fair skin; add a swipe of gloss on top and it's perfection.

I apply clear lip balm first for moisturization, then the Balm Stain and then another coat of clear balm over the top.  This little routine leaves the most natural wash of color and it lasts for quite a long time.  I'd say the color only begins to fade after the 3rd hour which to me is really great considering it is a lip product!  I love this product and will be repurchasing!!  :)"

It's a sheer lip gloss in stick form. The consistency is nice - very buttery and moisturizing. And the packaging is convenient- no leaks like you can get with a tube of gloss. But it really doesn't provide the lasting color that a stain provides. Be careful with your color selection, the exterior package color really doesn't represent the true color of the balm. When in doubt, choose a darker color than you think you need. I will continue to use this product, but probably wouldn't purchase again."

But when I put it on, it was a really natural and sheer tint. It's definitely buildable. It has a slight minty taste which I like but some people might not. It's also pretty moisturizing for a lip stain. But it doesn't really stain my lips, whether or not I have a lip balm on under it. It also wears off really easily for a stain. It's more like a lipstick in that way. But even still, I find it easier to apply than lipstick."

A quick web search on the best tinted lip balms (again, I was looking for subtle, not necessarily lipstick) this was one of the products I found.  It did go on easily, and may be a better product in another color.

The Lovesick comes off really bright pink on my lips and the Honey comes off as a baby soft pink. So don't expect the same color pay off to be the same on everybody. Still, they are great lip balm stains. Everyone should try them out because they last all day on the lips, with no need to reapply!!!!"

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","CurlySue8403","Toledo, Ohio",5,"Let me start by saying, I love buying lip products, but most of the time I really dislike wearing them unless it's some kind of balm or chapstick. I can't stand things that bleed or are sticky, and because I'm so extremely pale, many lip colors just look overwhelming on my face (especially paired with my red hair). I bought this on a whim. I really wanted to branch out of my neutral lippy safe zone and go for a berry lip this winter, but my lips were also super dry and flaky, despite all the moisturizing and exfoliation products I use. I grabbed the smitten color and I'm in LOVE. Normally stains cling to dry patches on my lips, or worse, bleed/feather after I put them on and then my super pale skin gets stained and I look like a 5 year old put my lipstick on for the better part of a day. This glides on smooth as butter, has a refreshing slightly minty/tingly feel and I found it really moisturizing. I also can put this on in the morning before leaving for the office, drink coffee, eat breakfast and lunch, and drink through the afternoon, and although this will transfer, it doesn't seem to effect the color payoff too much. The first day I wore this I still had some color on my lips when I got home 8+ hours later. It did start to get patchy towards the end of the day, but I finally have an all day lip product that requires minimal touch up and doesn't start to look goofy on me as it wears. I'm really happy with the Smitten shade too it's perfect for all day at the office (nice color payoff without being too much or too dramatic), and I'm sure I'll be picking up more. This is the lippy for those of us who love the look but hate to wear most lip products."

My lips are often a little less than smooth despite any external methods to prevent and treat.  Perhaps I'm just aging or dehydrated, but whatever my issue is, the application of this product is unsightly.  The color builds up over any slight imperfection, magnifying it.  And it doesn't last very long, but perhaps that is better because none of my tries are successful.  It's too bad, but I'll just do separate moisture over stain."

Remember you do need a lip balm underneath since the product can be a bit drying, but even when my lips were quite dry the product had even, beautiful coverage. My favorite way to wear it is by sheering it out a bit with my finger getting different shades, it's fun to experiment! The product does fade and slightly change color after a while, but nothing drastic. It smells minty, but it's subtle. As someone who hates lip products that smell like ANYTHING I found this to be pleasant and hardly noticeable. (This product also lasts while getting dunked into a pool)"

I love to wear red lipsticks but they always wear off so quickly. NOT THIS ONE! I can eat and drink all I want and it won't budge for hours. Once I actually put this on before I went to bed and I still had a faint red tint in the morning. If you want something that stays, this is for you. I wish there was a better color selection, because I know the colors are not really like what you you see in the tube. Mine was pretty close but it was more vibrant than I expected."

It really is a stain and yet not drying at all. It lasts about 4 hours for me, which is very good considering nothing else stays at all. One of the things I like best about it is that as it fades it does so without clumping, drying, or creating a goofy ring around my lips. I would love to try this in some of the other colors. I'm hoping they offer a good red for the holidays. I would say it is accurately described as a balm as it does seem to condition my lips, too."

I grabbed this due to my prior success with Revlon and was incredibly disappointed. It wears off on absolutely everything.

Some of the colors are more long lasting than others (Sweetheart will stay on your lips all day and into the next day if not carefully removed), but all of them are moisturizing and easily applied. I lips that are very prone to dryness, and I never have a problem with these. Honey is my favorite by far because it's one of those colors that is &quot;Your Lips but Better&quot;. I keep it in my purse all the time and it's easy enough to apply that you don't need a mirror. <br /><br />I do want to note that 1) they smell/ taste like peppermint (in case that's offensive to anyone) and 2) the colors aren't necessarily true to the tube color, and this is especially true for Honey. I would recommend looking up swatches online prior to purchase. <br /><br />Overall, I love these an I think they're definitely worth a try."

The minty feel of the balm is great, I wouldn't recommend this as your only lip moisturizer/balm, I still use a different balm at night.  The color(honey) is a great neutral, everyday color.  It is a bit more mauve than pink but I tend to lead toward darker colors anyway and was taking a risk when buying this color just based on the color of the packaging.  It really does stain your lips but because it is a light color it is not that noticeable. I'm sure the darker colors may leave more of a noticeable stain. Definitely worth the buy, will be buying again and possibly trying other colors."

This new stain balm is the perfect solution.  The precision of the chubby pencil makes lip liner unnecessary and it has an amazing, light peppermint scent.

I think if you buy this, you should definitely buy it at ulta because if you don't like the color you can return it! The packaging is close to the same color, but somewhat deceiving still. And of course the natural color of your lips has an effect on the color for you. I personally have brown hair, pretty fair skin, and blue/green eyes and I got this in &quot;Adore.&quot; It is perfect for me, not too bright and not too dark. Its kind of like a dusty rose...but in this case a dusty red, if that makes sense lol More of a deep red! But I love it and it's so cheap in comparison to tarte and better in my opinion!!"

I find it lasts a decent amount of time and it fades evenly, leaving a slightly darker stain behind. It doesnt stay too glossy for long but once it losses the gloss look it looks more like a stain.

But, I guess, for the price, it is not a fair comparison because Tarte Lip Surgence costs $24, Clinique Chubby Stick cost $15..So I guess, you got what you paid for. The texture, the application, the effectiveness are just like the ordinary lip balm; but just in a more impressive container/case.

I loveeee the romantic. It's a great shade of red for me (very fair, brunette). I usually have trouble wearing reds because they're too dark for me but this one was perfect. The cherish, on the other hand, was too bright. I've never had that problem with a lipcolor before. But honestly, it made me look like nicki minaj. NOT the look i was aiming for. My biggest gripe with the product is that it isn't as lasting as normal lip stains. Don't get me wrong, it lasted longer than lipsticks, just not what i was expecting. It was worth it for the moisture though. It didn't dry my lips out like every other lipstain out there. So not a bad compromise. I am probably going to end up buying serveral more. Most likely Charm and Adore. Fingers crossed on finding a better pink. Overall though, I am really pleased with the product :)"

I bought 2 (rendezvous &amp; charm) and they both work great. They all have a nice minty smell and just a little tingle. The color stays on your lips all day an you don't have to fumble with reapplying. These are very comparable to the clinique chubby sticks and the tarte lipstains. (i think they're even better.) they also roll up, so you don't have to bother/waste product with sharpening. i would suggest for everyone to get your hands on them!"
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","ohemjehnns","ca",5,"I love this product sooo much! I have only three shades: Adore, Romantic and Rendezvous! Rendezvous looks like a crazy orange, but my lips are naturally very mauve-y so it looks like a pretty coral color on my lips (not a clown-orange)! Romantic is a super cute pop of red that I think goes really well with my super fair skin! Adore is a deeper plum-y red which I also love. I think these work so well. As you apply, they are pretty much like a regular lipstick. It will still transfer a LITTLE bit if you drink or eat or kiss for like the first hour or so, but after a while, it will set and there will be a nice stain on your lips! It is NOT like the loreal lipstick (i forgot what those are called) and do not transfer at ALL once they are on your lips. These Revlon stains will still transfer in small amounts, but it is NOT anything like a regular lipstick because these will stain your lips! After most of the balm/lipstick part of it wears out, there will still be a nice stain. You can also reapply and it will still work just as great!<br />HOWEVER, Ive seen people say that these dont work and dont stain your lips. I think it's a little common sense that the LIGHTER colors will not be as visible in the staining part as the darker colors will be. And this is because our lips are already naturally pigmented, so most likely the lighter colors are not gonna show as visible when they are &quot;stained&quot; on the lips! Try the darker colors, such as the 'darker' pinks, oranges &amp; reds and Im 99% sure you'll be happy with these products!<br />Also, they have a menthol (minty) smell to them and they apply minty. However, they dont leave a tingly sensation (at least not on my lips) and the mintyness wears off after like a couple minutes.<br />I have so much to rave about them. Theyre already my new fave lippie!"

The only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is slightly drying. The great thing about it is that you can layer ANY gloss over it and not lose any of the color. With other stains you had to either use the gloss provided, or none at all. I love the ease of the product, the fact that it is only one tube, and the scent.

I am normally a fan of the marker-style lip stains and just put a balm on top of them once they dry, and wasn't sure if a &quot;balm stain&quot; would actually leave a stain once the balm wore off. I was wrong! I got this in Rendevous and it's great. It's a really pretty, slightly orangey peachy color and looks great with my fair skin. It goes on like a lipstick in crayon form, but feels like a balm once it's on your lips. I left it on for about 3 hours the day I got it, and by the end of the day my lips didn't feel dry, though they didn't feel quite as moisturized as they did when I initially applied it. Also, yes, it did stain my lips! I was not expecting it to work as a stain, so that was a nice surprise. Overall, I will probably be buying a couple more colors, and hope that Revlon expands the color selection further."

This color looked bright orange on me! I think this had to do partially with my skin tone and lip color, because I know many people really love that color and it looks more coral on them. <br /><br />I took it back and they were happy to exchange it so i picked up Charm instead. I am very happy with both colors I have now, Sweetheart is a bright pink that really gets noticed but I think it looks great! Charm is a peachy nude great for everyday. <br /><br />These are so easy to use! I love them for on-the-go. They do go on glossy and stay for a very long time but they lose their glossiness long before the color fades, so you may need a lipgloss if you want that glossy look and feel."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Marsy","California",5,"This is great! I bought this in Honey, which is a lovely sheer pink that I think would work as a my-lips-but-better color for a wide range of skin tones. It's a bit sheer but can be built up, is not drying at all (I wouldn't use it as a moisturizer, though), and lasts for several hours and even through reasonably not-messy meals. It has a bit of a minty smell, which I enjoyed. The twist-up crayon form is convenient.<br /><br />I also have the Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm in Sultry (another pink), and I find that the matte balm is much more pigmented. I would buy this again in another color or if/when I use it up."

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Mlle_Milla","Miami, FL",5,"I absolutely love these products! I have it in 2 shades (&quot;honey&quot; and &quot;love sick&quot;), but I definitely want to get more! Honey is a pinky-nude; it's great for everyday and looks great on women of color. Love sick is a very hot pink, perfect for a fun night out. It's VERY moisturizing and long lasting. With both shades, I went out (and even ate!) and there was still some shine to them HOURS (maybe 3 hours?) later. During a work day, I reapplied &quot;Honey&quot; maybe once. However, as honey dries it does look more dark pink than natural/nude but I like it!<br /><br />The color is also buildable, you can wear it very sheer or add more layers to deepen the color. I also recommend using a lip liner because it makes it look much neater and cleaner. The shine and moisturizing effect lasts longer than I expected, but if you have drier, more chapped lips, I recommend exfoliating your lips to prep. It's very high quality and I highly recommend.<br /><br />I would be careful with color selection. Try the test samples in store to figure out your best matches...depending on your skin tone some of the colors might look very similar on you. I tried it in &quot;Cherish&quot; but it did not really show up on me, I would not recommend that shade if you have a deeper skin tone. It's so light I should have realized. They are very true to their color. I want to get rendezvous, smitten, and/or cherish next!"

I will tell you that when I first opened mine up, I was a little intimidated! But I really like this color! It's very buildable, so I can layer it on if I want more POP! But one of my favorite things about this is that when I wipe it off, it still leaves a little bit of a cherry red/pink color on my lips, and it's still nice and shiny!<br /><br />Now for the negatives... First off, the tip of the stick broke off after the first use, and made a HUGE MESS all over my face. Not fun! Luckily, it's retractable. Just be careful of how much pressure you use when applying! And second, that pepermint smell... At first, I hated it and found it much too strong, but I've gotten used to it and find it quite nice! Some people might find the smell unpleasant or distracting though. (Side note: even though it smells minty, has very little taste.)"

I have very very light/whitish mauve lips, so I really like it when a lipcolor leaves some stain.  I have tried 4 of these.  Be aware, the starting color is not the same as the stain that is left. The stain tended to be brighter than the starting color. (Which makes sense.)and the packaging does not reflect color all that well. Also, I suspect the stain might come out differently on different people (chemistry?)  <br />Smitten:  Lovely deep fuschia when it goes on. Left a different and much brighter crazy fuschia stain that actually was pretty but way too bright for me.  Think I will give this to a friend.<br />Crush:  Lovely grape.  The stain is fairly true grape, but sadly this was the only stain that sort of settled into lip lines a bit.  I will keep trying.<br />Adore:  nice sort of brick color, very wearable.  Left a medium brick but slightly pinker/brighter stain.   It is not &quot;red lipstick&quot; and might work for you if you tend to browns.  Wish the stain left was more like the start color.<br />Honey:  So different than package.  Not pink.  In the tube it looks like a nude.  On, it is a mauvey nude, and the stain was more mauve.  I could wear this all the time, just to get my lips to look normal lip color.<br /><br />All went on lovely and smooth and soft.  But all left my lips dry after balm wore off.  Then at least on Adore and Smitten, re-app made for a really bright and unpredictable stain.<br /><br />If you get this and find the stain too crazy bright, try applying over lip balm.  That seemed to make the stain aspect softer. I think this product is best for someone like me who really needs some color to stick around, and is more concerned with having some color, than it being exactly the desired color!!<br />(and if the specific color is important, be sure to re-check in mirror frequently the first couple times you use so you can see how it develops on you.)"

We are unable to rate the performance aspects of it because as soon as she applied it, her lips broke out in a raised, red rash. Obviously some ingredient in it caused an immediate allergic reaction.

What I like most about this product is that it comes on strong (but not as strong as lipstick) and by the end of the day it fades but the color still shows. Some might hate this, but I love it because I like the really natural lip color look; I'm not really a big fan of such bold lips for everyday. I use a TINY bit of Vaseline before I apply this lipstain, and it glides right on! I recommend this for those who like the natural lip look!"

They both go on your lips the exact color of the tubes they come in, so you know what you're getting.  I've worn Honey almost everyday since I got it- it goes with anything.  Sweetheart is a bright pink with almost a slight berry hue to it, so it's a really fun color.  Both colors last forever!  I can go probably 5 hours before I notice any fading.  I love the crayon-like application because all you have to do is color within the lines.  <br />  The only con for these stains is at first it goes on feeling like a balm, but the balm quickly fades and it ends up drying my lips out a little.  However, I can totally live with that because the the color stays on forever even when the balm doesn't."

The price is nice and usually can get the best deals on these during a Revlon product sale plus store coupon. They glide on very nicely, and sort of do give you a moisturized feel. However, that moist feeling does seem to wear off after a bit. Sometimes I might have to top it with my favorite lip balm or a gloss. It does stain a bit, so you do get a long wearing effect. I've used other more prestigious lines and the moisturizing effects are better, but don't wear as long (don't stain). There is a little bit of a funny scent to these. Although, after wearing them for a few mins, you really don't smell it any more. Colors are pretty true to color and seem to be on the brighter side, unless you go for the softer nude tones, then of course they come out pretty natural. I say give them a try."

Sweetheart, romantic, and lovesick show their true colors. Sweetheart and lovesick are very similar colors so I would recommend lovesick for a more cool toned color and sweetheart for a more warm toned color. Honey is a good light color for everyday but its stain is a dark magenta, unlike the original pale pink."

Works really well if worn on top of the Revlon Lip Butters.  Otherwise, it might be too drying.

They are absolutely beautiful--soft, buttery, pigmented yet a little on the sheer side, but I think that depends on the color you buy. For example, I tried Romantic(red) and it wasn't the mot pigmented and it was very sheer. These do stain well, but I do think they need to be reapplied at least once. They also look nice over other lipsticks. They can be a little sticky, but they're just as sticky as any lip balm. These are an exact dupe for Tarte's Lip Surgence chubby sticks, except there is a smaller variety of colors and finishes. If Revlon came out with a Matte version of these, that would be perfect! Over all, I want almost every color of these in my makeup collection right now (except Romantic. I disliked that color, but if you're looking for a bright sheer red, it's for you.):)"

Smitten I've been wearing every day since its lighter for daytime and adore I just got, which is more red. I wish they had more nuetral pink colors and less vibrant colors since when I tried Charm I didn't like the nude, plus for me I feel the point of a lipstain is for the colors!

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","Meg","New York, NY",4,"I have the colors Honey and Sweetheart. Honey tends to change color over time, from a brownish pink to a brighter pink. Sweetheart is very bright in person, too bright for my taste and unsuitable for my yellow undertones. It does however, look good if applied with a light hand on top of another lip product, like a gloss or another lipstick. The color Sweetheart will probably look better on cooler skin tones while Honey is a versatile color, or at least until the color changes. These colors do apply evenly and have a pleasant light minty scent. The lasting power in this lipstick is good, however, it is not phenomenal. As long as the balm texture is still on your lips, the color will transfer to whatever your lips touch. Once the balm component wears off, and you'll know this when it feels like there is no product on your lips, the color does not transfer (unless you rub really hard with a napkin). Make sure your lips are not chapped before you put this on because the results will not be pretty!"

It just doesn't match my skin tone (south east asian, medium skin tone)<br /><br />I wouldn't say that the product lasts very long or moisturizes but it's decent. The colors of the sticks aren't exactly true to the actual colors of the product but I just got lucky."

I would say that this product is more of a lip stain than a gloss or lipstick. It has a nice smell when I first put it on; it's slightly minty. However, later on it starts to taste strange. In addition, it does dry my lips out a bit. I would suggest to apply generously and then when it begins to fade apply some tinted, moisturizing gloss."

It slides on like a gloss crayon, lips feel smooth and mositurized. Then, after a minute or less, the glossy color sets into a great stain and it does not come off even after you put another gloss on top. Lips stayed colored for 6+ hours even through drinks and dinner. I wear the Crush shade which is a summery berry shade - so pretty. I will never go back to those felt pen or messy stain in a nailpolish-type bottle lip stains anymore - my new favorite product is this Revlon balm stain crayon! Anyone who has used other stains or long wearing stain lipsticks, you will love these balm sticks. A whole new level and the feel is so much nicer."

I love it so much that I went to buy another one in Crush today!!! I did a lot of research before purchasing this produt, online and personal experience, and this Balm/Stain wins hands down in comparison to the rest."
"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","starkitty526","Raleigh, NC",4,"First - I have lips that are prone to drying and a slightly strange skin tone, so I consider myself to be VERY picky (especially about lip products, as everything seems to pink on me and my skin is olive - not the best combo...).  I have light olive skin, so I tend to look best in true neutral shades - not leaning toward orange or blue tones, but dusty pinks, brick reds, some peach-tinted pinks...  At first, I was really skeptical about the color selection.  The first color I got was Sweetheart, thinking it would be a good slightly peachy summery pink.  It's not.  :(  It's very bright, definitely summery.  The initial color is a bit shocking, but it fades into the lips after a few minutes, so after the initial shock, it actually faded into a nice flush of color that will be nice for summer (If I can get used to the fact that it's not a color that I would normally wear).  It does have some blue in it - it's very much a Barbie pink - but it will be good for the season, I'm just not sure I'll actually be reaching for it on a regular basis.  Now for the good part of the review - I loved the texture and the wear of the product so much, that I actually researched the colors and went back to get a couple more that I would actually want to wear more often.  I ended up with Honey and Adore.  In all of the swatches, Honey looks very neutral and brownish, but on me it's actually this really great slightly rose nude color.  Extremely wearable, and oddly long-lasting.  I put it on last night and, after 4 hours of wear (including eating and drinking - both cold and hot beverages), then removing my makeup, there was still a slight flush of color on my lips when I woke up this morning.  WOW!  When I put it on, I remember thinking it wasn't super-pigmented, but that should tell you how natural-looking this color is, since it was still detectable in the morning.  As someone who can't pull off a truly nude lip (with my skin tone, it makes me look like a corpse), this natural lip look will be great with any makeup look.  The other color, Adore, is pretty true to the packaging color.  It's a reddish wine color, but it has some brown in it, so it doesn't run too cool. I consider it to be a very wearable red-tone, but it's not garish or shocking like a true red or a coral red can be.  I really like the minty taste, and it actually has a balmy feel.  The balmy feel does wear off after awhile, but it's not as bad as a regular stain.  This formulation does not seem to be drying, either, even after you wear it for several hours.  The one word of caution I would say (for all 3 colors) is that the color is very buildable and, as this is a stain, if you put a ton on and it ends up being too bright, you will be somewhat stuck with the result for awhile.  The only thing that cost this product a star is that there's no SPF protection in it.  That would have made it truly perfect - especially heading into summer.  Overall, I think these are great.  One of the best new lip products out there.  Get them while they're on sale and grab them when you see them, they're going fast!"

They are very moisturizing and the color is great. Charm is my go to nude- looks good for everyday. I love Sweetheart for it's rich, pink color. I'm careful when applying it because the color is very rich. I'm still experimenting with the Cherish color. I like it, but it's not exactly right- too pale for me? Overal, great lip colors. I would buy them all."

"http://www.ulta.com/color-stay-just-bitten-kissable-balm-stain?productId=xlsImpprod4410269","beautycutie101","Orlando, FL",4,"Now I bought this in the color 025 Sweetheart Valentine. It is very pink and pigmented. You  can build on the color very easily. The shade is however, way to pink and bright for me. I like natural and lighter pink or peaches. I am going back to Ulta to purchase it in the Honey color. I was able to bring down the intensity of the color by smudging my lips with a paper towel right after I out it on and before it dried. It is not moisturizing but not drying. I do apply a gloss/chap stick over it. You do not need much to cover all your lips and it will last you forever. it lasts a very long time. It has lasted through two meals, several glasses of water, my scrubbing it off, and dozens of applications of gloss and chap sticks because I love applying them and it is long lasting. I was slightly disappointed that it did not come with a chap stick end like the marker version does. I think it's just because the marker on was very drying I hear. The concept is nice, but I can not believe how few color choices were. These are ideal for summer looks, perfect for water parks, the beach. But the colors are much more winter and night shades for my taste. I do not hate this color, but I do need to smudge it out and sometimes a very sheer nude gloss or lipstick over it for some days. It's mostly personal opinion. Absolutely no sparkle so that's something I like. It does not smell bad, but it resembles other Revlon lip products. Not as unpleasant as many other  lip stains I have used before."

The stains go one easily and are super moisturizing with an initially glossy finish that fades to a matte stain. The minty smell is also nice while not being overpowering. The exterior tubes are NOT true to color so I suggest looking at online reviews and swatches before investing in one. So far, I own three - Precious (sheer nude), Sweetheart (bright pink) and Lovestruck (bright fuscia). While Sweetheart is initially a very  sheer nude the stain does not last. With Sweetheart and Lovestruck, however, they last for hours. I've made it through dinner, drinks and a full night of sleep and still had stain on in the morning. They fade evenly and come off easily in the shower. I've heard several people say they even prefer these to Tarte's equivalnet (several times the price of these!). Honestly worth a shot. You'll fall in love."

I am a very dry person and while these do dry my lips out a bit, it is the least drying stain I've ever used.  The chubby crayon applicator makes it so easy to apply, it goes on evenly, and lasts all day! The only negative would be the scent.  It smells like peppermint. I hate peppermint but luckily after its applied the smell goes away so I only suffer for a minute or two while applying.  The beautiful color and long lasting wear definitely make up for the gross smell."

I thought it would match my dress color, judging by the outer package. However, these are glossy and rather sheer. It wasn't nearly as dark as I expected, but was still very nice and did go well with my dress. This is a great fall and winter lip product. Adore is a gorgeous fall burgundy type red with gold flecks. It's definitely daytime appropriate and easy to wear, but looks great for dressier events as well. They smell like mint, are moisturizing and last a while. The crayon twists up and is easy to apply. However, the formula can be a bit patchy, particularly on the first application. I recommend putting on a layer, blotting, then reapplying for smooth application."

I get asked about this more than any lip product I've ever worn. It feels awesome to answer because I think people expect that it's going to be some high-end product, but when I tell people it's Revlon, they are shocked. I really can put it on before I go out, and there will still be color at the end of the night. I usually take another tinted balm out with me (not stain), but even if I don't use that, I'm amazed that the color is still there. It doesn't feather or clump or fade out in a patchy way.

I use it everyday and trust me, I don't haver to apply it often.  The color is buildable- you can go sheer or add more for drama.  I thought the colors looked similar- some are just darker or brighter than others, so I couldn't make up my mind and bought three different colors. The only downfall is that even though they are different colors, they seemed to stain my lips the same color or similar to eachother making me wonder if it was even necessary to buy three different shades.  If you do purchase these in more than one color, don't buy similar colors, because they will look exactly the same.  Instead, aim for very different color variations."

The minty feel threw me off at first, but it doesn't last long. I'm fair skinned with yellow and pink undertones, medium brown hair, green eyes. I went for Cherish for a cool pink tone, and Smitten for a brighter color (this shade makes my teeth look whiter).

It does last a long time, but the brightness fades if you eat, drink, etc. I love it because my boyfriend actually kisses me with it on, whereas lipstick comes off and lip gloss feels sticky to him.

I diagree that they are drying, bc when initially put on they are moisturizing like a balm, but even lip balms wear out after a while and have to be reapplied. It starts out as a balm and stains the lips; so the stain stays, but I would recommend applying regular lip balm after a few hours, bc the color will still be there, the balm-y feeling will not.

This is the first lip stain that i have tried that actually STAINS my lips. I have tried out multiple shades from tge covergirl outlast collection, and although the color looked nice at the beggining of the day, i hated the dry formulation as well as the lasting power of the product. Within one hour, the 'stain' would have almost entirely faded, but worse than that, it often would leave splotchy coloration in the fine lines of my lips. <br />This product looks lovely when you first apply it, and lasts significantly longer than the stain by covergirl. My favorite part though is that it fades to a very even, natural look, so that you arent left looking like a hot mess. It also has a slight moisurizing quality to it, and is much easier to apply then dry formula lip stains. I purchased the color Lovesick, and find that it is very versitile and buildable, allowing for you to achieve both bold and natural looks."

I think the lip stain aspect of this product is great... until it begins to wear off.

Of course it is a stain which is super and it lasts a long time without drying like the other stains I've tried. It also can be dual purpose lipstick / gloss, just layer it."

I have almost all of the colors...only waiting for the other colors to come in stock to grab them too ;) I love that they're super pigmented and if you give them a bit of time (about 15-20 minutes) they'll completely set for the whole day! I went to a party with these and ate and drank a lot but no color came off but my lips looked as it did when I first appllied them (giving ample time for the color to set). The stain that the darker colors leave behind are true to color however the lighter ones like honey, became a fuschia/magenta on my lips (may be because i got a defective-ish one or my lips are pigmented?) However, I still love these! When you first apply, they are moisturizing but when the balm wears off I recommend having a balm handy to keep them moisturized unless you want to reapply the balmstain again. I do not recommend applying these to chapped lips because it will cause uneveness and looks reallly weird. They also have a weird minty smell...I usually love minty smells but this one is a little unpleasant. However, the smell does not stick around once it;s on your lips."

They took forever to ship to my house due to the Christmas holiday and New Years.  This review is for the Smitten color. I received the product brand new, and wrapped up in plastic packaging, but when I removed the cap, I found fingerprints inside!! It was gross!! I was a bit disappointed. They were definitely not from me, and I had to wipe it w/ a tissue to get rid of them, which wiped off a bit of lip product :( The other two lip balms were clean and brand new though (no fingerprints).  However, the product's overall performance was great; it was moisturizing even without reapplying lip balm, had a bit of staining power, and the color was very pretty, a berry-pinkish color. The color does tend to change slightly as the lip color wears off on your lips. It has a nice minty smell and feeling on your lips, which goes away after a minute. Smitten can be worn during the day and for going out, depending on how much you apply on your lips. I would have given it a 5-star rating if there hadn't been the nasty finger prints inside!! Always check your lip products before applying them on your lips, even if they are brand new!!"

So far I have been through almost one each of the Honey and Rendezvous. I keep one of each with my makeup at home and one of each in my purse. The honey is for cool days and the Rendezvous is for peachy days. These two colors are fool-proof in application. You slap them on like lip balm and swipe down your filtrum and you're good to go. They have a slight sheen like lip balm and make your lips look soft and moist but not glossy. Both are beautiful soft colors that are only slightly darker than most natural lip tones. With the Honey it looks like my natural lips, but better and the color lasts and isn't as drying as most stains. I end up reapplying, not for color but to keep my lips from getting chapped from the winter weather. <br /><br />The Smitten and Crush are not as wearable for me, at work, but would be great for going out. In fact, most of the colors just don't seem wearable on a daily basis. However, I'm totally happy with the two colors that I'm using constantly and have have bought an extra of Honey and will continue to stock up when it's on sale. I would hate for them to discontinue this product. I was using the liquid Just Bitten before they came out with this and thought I was fine with it. This product is so much better that I wouldn't want to go back. The tube lasts soooooo much longer than the liquid too. I could go through a pen in several weeks and I've been working on the balms for months and am not out."

The container led me to believe it would be more the latter, but it turns out it's more the former. (I would argue the above picture offers the same color misrepresentation. It is not as deep a shade as you see above.) For this reason, I really don't like wearing this by itself.<br /><br />I get the best results when I wear this over a berry red marker lip stain. Between the two products, my lips are a red I love, and they remain red all day. Even with eating and drinking and only applying colorless lip balm throughout the day, I find my lips still have noticeable tint 10-12 hours later.<br /><br />I think the product itself is a good one, but I have some serious misgivings about the color represented. I strongly recommend testing before you buy."

The liquid formulas w/ doe foot applicators of days past lasted a long time, but they were drying and irritated my lips if I used them daily.  (UGH)  I found these AMAZING balm stains several years ago and have not looked back.  The brighter, darker colors of this line stain your lips best.  Some of the colors look different on your lips than on the exterior, (so buy from Ulta so you can exchange if you don't like a color!).  HOW I USE TO GET THE BEST EFFECT:  I draw the color onto my lips, carefully tracing the edges to make them look fuller.  I let the color sit for about 30 minutes.  I then use a tissue to blot off excess color, (press to blot, don't rub) .  I do this two to three times, or until I reach my desired intensity.  This super easy process mutes the color to a WEARABLE intensity and leaves a gorgeous natural flush of color on my lips.  LOVE, LOVE LOVE!

It was very subtle yet added some color. The product applies very nicely. It had a great minty smell and a pretty good color pay off. Unlike stains, it stays glossy and does not dry your lips at all. However, I was very disappointed in the longevity of the product. Even though it is labelled as a stain, it wears off after 2-3 hours just like any lipstick would. Also, for me it would wear off and then just leave an outline on my lips. Overall, was expecting a lot more from this product."

Only problem is that the plastic of the container doesn't necessarily match the color of the balm, so it's a bit hard to pick which color is best.  (Ulta: can we get some testers, please?)<br /><br />The only other issue I had was with the slightly sweet minty flavor.  I'm not fond of minty lip products - it makes me feel like I've got toothpaste drool on my face.  But it's not overwhelming and fades after application."

I've used Revlon's Just Bitten stain before, and wasn't impressed.  But for some reason, this really hits the right mark.  I like that it goes on more like a lipstick or balm, but the stain does remain (and EVENLY too, which is an issue I had with the Just Bitten stain/gloss combo thing) even after the &quot;gloss&quot; part wears off.  So even though your lips may feel drier, your color is still there.  I really appreciate it, as I cannot be bothered to check and reapply all day.  <br /><br />Basically, this has the nice color of the Covergirl stains, but has better staying power and better moisturization.

Applies easily, long lasting- without drying, and a great price! Very similar to the Tarte lip stain, but much more affordable. I purchased 3!"

This is the first and only lip stain that doesn't instantly make me feel like I need chapstick. It goes on and feels more like a lip balm than a lip stain, but it stays on WAY longer than any other lip balm I've ever tried. I will definitely continue buying and using this product, and would recommend it to anyone!"

It has a bit deeper color than the pencil case color, which I like. Goes on smooth, looks natural only better. The color does last a little longer than regular lip balm but certainly not all day.  A really nice feature is that it is a wind-up and not one that has to be sharpened. Wish there was a larger selection of colors. Overall can recommend this lip stain balm. I'll probably buy more."

I've found that with normal liquid stains they'll fade in some places on the lips and you can't get it off other parts... It can be frustrating. <br /><br />But with this balm stain the application goes on so even and it doubles as a lip balm, too. You get color and hydration for hours. I fell asleep wearing this and when I woke up I still had color and my lips weren't chapped at all.<br /><br />The only slight downside is that you don't get as much color as you would a lipstick. I bought this in 'Adore' and I thought it would be a deeper, more intense red.<br /><br />The color is still gorgeous but not quite what I was expecting."
