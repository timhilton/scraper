"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","LC","Long Branch, NJ",1,"It does go on nice and smooth but smudges absolutely everywhere so quick. I had only put it on my top lid and it was half way down my cheeks. Probably one of the worst eyeliners I've ever used."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","Tiff","Michigan",4,"I got the blue and yellow liners and I love them! I hardly ever see drugstore brands have PIGMENTED pastels. I used these both on the upper lash line and waterline, the waterline only lasted about 4 1/2 hours. But they are so perfect for the upper lash line to give an extra pop of color, they lasted about 9 hours before smudging on my lid. Which is awesome, because I didn't use primer. (I consider my lids to be normal, not overly dry or oily.) The blue took only two swipes to be opaque and the yellow took three.<br /><br />These are very comparable to Stila smudge sticks, only a little more creamy/smooth. I would love to see more colors with this particular liner."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","saral","Milwaukee, WI",5,"This is the one and only eyeliner pencil i have found that keeps my waterline rimmed! It also stays on my top lash line all day long.  I never leave reviews, but i am that confident about this eyeliner."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","BeetyBoop","Winston Salem NC",1,"I was hoping this would last as long as the Revlon Colorstay eyeliner (which I have used for yrs.) but this one doesn't.  It only lasted a couple hrs. then smudged and faded."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","Eyes","Florida",4,"Eyes. It's a liner. Also has a smug tip on opposite side of pencil.   It goes on smoothly holds pigment all day. Even on hot humid days"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","Chiby","Houston TX",1,"30 minutes after applied it looked like i cried. I don't recommend it at all"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","TP","NY",1,"I use blackest black colors for eyes on daily basis. Revlon was best pencil I used for over 15 years. Daily. But then, first, they kept making pencils shorter and shorter and each time more expensive. I still loved the color and kept buying. But now its nonsense. Among pencils there is no black, at most dark grey. I tried to add liner that they labeled blackest black, but it looks at best light gray or medium brown. Looks like I have to switch the company. Revlon, please get your blackest black pencils back."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","Nova","Michigan",1,"I bought this to line my waterline and it was horrible! Within 10 minutes it was smudging at both corners of my eyes. Also it went on a nice dark black but immediately faded to a dark grey color. Very disappointed."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","MishyMash","Bellevue, WA",4,"Purchased assuming that it was a twist up, I had planned on giving to a friend . . until I tried it.  It goes on smoothly, stays put all day long, doesn't irritate sensitive eyes, and the Marine Green looks amazing.  I actually repurchased a spare, along with a sharpener -- a very happy accident."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","Monika the realtor","Northern Virginia",5,"I have worn this as my daily eye liner for over 2 years.  I have brown/bluish timt eyes and somehow this works forme.  There is rarely a week that 2 or 3 people don't comment about how much they love this eye liner.  Occasionally I will switch to some other color and don't recall ever having received any comments on those!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-kajal-eye-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod11851091","Depaul","chicago",5,"I have oily eyelids and most products will melt on my eyes and most primers won't do anything. I haven't used kajal eyeliners for years since they always smudged so badly on me. I decided to give this one a go since waterproof eyeliners that stay on well are hard to blend and won't give me a nice soft smokey look. It glides on, it's a beautiful shade of brown, not too ginger or too dark just perfect. It does fade throughout the day as anything will but considering my oily eyelids it performs really well."
