"http://www.ulta.com/kiss-balm-lip-balm?productId=xlsImpprod15361049","Justagirl","TX",5,"This peach balm is awesome! It smells so peachy! It doesn't really give a tint of color IMO, if that's what you're hoping for but I guess it also depends on your tone and everything. For me it mainly gave me what seems like a clear gloss. It gives nice hydration to your lips and stays on for a good bit. I love the tube it comes in with a lid but the lid can come off in your bag if you're swinging it around or a bit rough with it. The only thing I dislike about this product is that it contains oxybenzone. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

It feels so good on your lips, has the slightest sweet smell, gives shine with a touch of color, stays put, and protects! I started off with just the Revlon Kiss&trade; Balm in Strawberry Fraise Fraiche shade. Loved it so much I went to the store and purchased the whole collection. What I love about this lip balm. First, the flavor isn't cloying or sickeningly sweet, and it's the perfect amount of Strawberry Fraise Fraiche that doesn't taste fake. The second is the consistency and the way it goes on. It's not at all heavy or goopy and reminds me a lot of EOS lip balms. There's quite a bit in the tube as it twists up when you need more. I would definitely recommend it.

The smell was fantastic, and lasted a long time, and smelled just like peaches.  It was so enjoyable to wear!  I also liked using it as a balm, as it was very hydrating to my lips and felt smooth and not sticky.  It actually worked too to hydrate my lips.  There was no color added on my  lips, which I like in a balm so pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the size of the stick is a little too small, and would be better if it was a little wider.  I had to do multiple swipes instead of just one, which was fine, but other products have this better.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/kiss-balm-lip-balm?productId=xlsImpprod15361049","Color Lover","Utah",4,"This balm is wonderful. Usually in this type of product you get a very greasy or waxy feeling when you apply it to your lips, this one did not. I was so surprised by the feel that I didn't really notice how much or in this case how little product it took to cover my lips. Usually most lip balms put a coating on your lips which takes a nice little dent out which means that it wont last too long if your a lip balm enthusiast. However Revlon Kiss is super light, so much so that it didn't even look like I used the balm once after a couple applications, so to me that means that its going to last a very long time. Now with that said I actually didn't care for the smell (hence only 4 stars), I only like fresh coconut not the flakes or shredded or even the &quot;artificial&quot; coconut extract flavor or smell. To me this smelled just like that artificial coconut flavor, so if your like me then this flavor isn't for you, but since I like this product so well, I'm going to get the Peach one and give that a try. I'm pretty sure I'll have better luck with that one. <br />(This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

AND I LOVE STRAWBERRY FLAVORED CANDIES or anything strawberry related for that matter BUT really I'm glad I got this flavor! I like how it has SPF because the balm I'm using now doesn't have SPF protection so it's something new to me. Also, it was moisturizing but the thing is for me it didn't last long. I had to reapply product like every 2 hours and while I love the flavor/smell it's kinda tiring to always reapply. I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for this but if you are the type of person who doesn't mind retouching every hour or so then I guess this product is okay for you!

I'm an avid lip balm user but I have been using the same flavor and brand since I was nine years old. I have tries many others but never buy them more than once. The Revlon Kiss leaves my lips moisturized and soft with a slight waxy feeling but not sticky. Has a sheer tint but I feel like it won't be noticeable on most lip. The scent on this is amazing! Unlike many other products claiming to smell like peaches, this one really does. It doesn't however taste like it. I like that even in the strongest of winds it protected my lips from becoming dry.

Reminds you of summer which I will really be looking forward to about January.  It goes on smooth.  The applicator feels a little off on my lips but it may be because of the rounded top.  Due to the rounded shape- it does not cover the entire lip in a swipe.  Instead you need to go over your lips a couple times.  That was really the only things that kept me from rating it as a 5 star.  It moisturizes well and seems to keep my lips conditioned for several hours at a time."

Most tinted balms I have used have just a slight tint of color but I was really impressed with this one. It has a lot more color than I thought it would. I love the shade of Fresh Strawberry. It's a light pink shade (right up my ally) and it's really pretty. It smells really good. Has a nice strawberry scent. It also has a pleasant taste.

The smell is decadent, and absolutely smells as supposed to (like fresh strawberries).  I was quite impressed by the benefit of SPF 20 and the combination of natural fruit oils as well.  Although I had thought that it would have left a pinker tint to my lips - it barely colored my lips a cheery pink - I still  enjoyed using this product.  The balm left my lips feeling hydrated, and I could picture using multiple applications throughout the day.  The packaging was a bit simplistic, so I it did not naturally catch my attention as quickly as some products do.  Additionally, it mentions that it's use is too help prevent sunburn, which is always a bonus. I had a rather positive experience with this Kiss Balm, and would have to say that of those available this is probably my favorite variation.  Hence, I have rated this product five out of five stars, would definitely purchase this product, and would recommend to a friend or family member.

The packing grabbed my attention first. It is a nice light orange/peach colour. I also noticed the tip was not too thin or too thick. I liked this because I was able to get it on the thinner part of my lips without getting it all over my skin. The lid was also very secure which is nice as many caps tend to fall off in my purse. I loved the smell of the Kiss Balm. It was not to sweet and not too strong. It did a good job on moisturizing my lips for a few hours. It lasted me around six hours each application. It definitely lasts longer than many I have used but not as long as a couple. It also held up well when I put other lip colours on my lips for various events or just for fun.

I found that I didn't have to constantly reapply this. I have naturally dry lips, so that was a major plus for me. I didn't find that there was much, if any, pigmentation. My lips are naturally very pigmented, though, so that may be why i did not see any color. It was not overly glossy or shiny. There was just a nice sheen on the lips.

It is not sticky or overly thick.  If you remember the old rollerball glosses from the 70s and 80s, this is a much more comfortable, convenient version.

"http://www.ulta.com/kiss-balm-lip-balm?productId=xlsImpprod15361049","Marshall","Dallas, TX",4,"I am a big fan of tinted lip balms. On those days where I'm not wearing any makeup, or have gone super natural, there's nothing quite like being able to just throw on some lip balm, and still get a little bit of color. So I was pretty excited to try out the Revlon Kiss Balm.<br />Upon receiving my package of Revlon Kiss Balm in Strawberry, I was surprised to find that my product had no lid. The package was completely sealed, obviously not tampered with, but where there should have been a lid, there was none. So the tip of the product had been smashed, and there was no hope of my ever being able to take it with me anywhere. As I'm sure this product was meant to come with a lid, there was clearly an issue somewhere in quality control. If I had found this product like this in a store, I clearly would not have bought it. <br />Now, the product itself seems nice enough. I, of course, sanitized it before use (because, you know, no lid). The formula is very smooth, and just glides on, leaving behind a soft, pinky-red tint. The consistency is pretty gel-like, and very moisturizing, leaving your lips feeling very soft and smooth, and looking nice and full. It boasts an SPF of 20, perfect for days spent at the beach, or lounging around at a barbecue. The scent is not exactly what I would call strawberry - it's a very sugary,  almost fruity, vaguely plastic-y scent which I wasn't really all that fond of, but isn't the worst thing ever, especially since the actual  formula was so nice. <br />Overall, I was mostly a fan of this product. I loved how it felt on the lips, the splash of color it left behind, and I'm all for anything with SPF in it. But the scent left something to be desired, and the fact that it came without a lid? That alone was a huge bummer. I can't take it with me anywhere, and what's the point of a lip balm you can't take anywhere? <br />*This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I have this in the Berry color and love that it is buildable from just barely a hint of color, to a beautiful berry color that really shows up nicely (although, admittedly, my lips are pale). I keep one in the car because it serves so many purposes: 1) It contains a sunscreen, which most balms do not, so if I am going to apply a balm on the go, I may as well get a little sun protection too 2) I love the fact that I can build the color of this shade up. In the morning, running the kids to school, I am bare faced and this is nice for a hint of tint. In the later part of the day, I enjoy that this can serve to give me a little more color punch and shine and compliment a full makeup look, while still looking natural 3) These feel really good on my chapped lips and improve the condition of my lips 4) It has sunscreen and even though it could offer better protection than just spf 20, it is better than nothing while in my car with the sun shining in 5) This stuff is a beauty bargain!

I used the Juicy Peach flavor, which I was a little hesitant about as I am not always a fan of peach scented or flavored things. The scent and flavor was subtle and not overpowering at all. The application was incredibly smooth. Almost too smooth. The product is very soft and creamy, and I easily had excess product on my lips I had to gently wipe away. The soft nature also made this product more prone to getting damaged. Despite this, I still loved how moisturized my lips felt and the touch of color it added really brightened up my look and feel.

The scent lasts for quite a while, too.  I love the fact that this product protects my lips from the sun with SPF 20.  My favorite aspect of this lip balm is how smoothly it applies.  It feels nice and light on my lips, as opposed to heavy or waxy like some other lip balms.  This particular scent/flavor doesn't provide much color to my lips (maybe just a hint of shimmery light pink), but it does leave a nice shine.  I definitely recommend this product for lightweight sun protection with a touch of shine!"

I bought the peach scent which smells and tastes great. Not artificial or overly sweet. If you're looking for something to moisturize your lips for a long period of time I wouldn't recommend this as it wears off easily and quickly."

I find it to be very moisturizing on the lips plus the scents are rediculously yummy! Yes, these are pretty sheer but perfect balm to layer. I bought the Coconut and the next day went back and purchased the peach and strawberry... Hope this continues to stay in the arevlin line. Solid product, IMO."

These are very thin and sheer. I got the berry shade and it's a pretty, sheer wash of color but the texture is very very thin and almost slightly oily. It dries my lips out badly."
