"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Pompomlover","Sioux Falls, SD",5,"I didn't realize at first that this was a fiber mascara as it isn't a feature shown brightly on the packaging... But  it works amazingly to add volume and then a little goth.  Needed to apply several costs to get the look I wanted but once I did it was beautiful.  You will need a good waterproof eye makeup remover tho so be warned about that.....my oil remover even needs a couple of applications to do the job."

I have the same mascara but with the red lid and LOVE that but this one just plain did not work."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","EL","Kansas City",5,"This mascara does really well at separating my lashes. It's pretty decent at length and volume. I prefer this over the $25 Benefits mascara I've been using!"
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","laura","western mass",3,"nothing special. Its a solid everyday mascara but nothing remarkable. doesnt flake or smudge but doesn't give you super volume or length. I've noticed no matter how much I curl my lashes this tends to straighten them out as it drys."

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Olivia Begnel","O'Fallon, Missouri",1,"This mascara made my lashes clumpy, and overall didn't do anything great for them. Also this came of just as any other mascara would. But this is the only one of their mascara i've tried, so i'm not saying the others are bad either."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Dawness71","Lawton, OK",5,"I love the length it gives my lashes. I used to use Max Factor 2000 calories. Now that you can't find it in the stores anymore, this Revlon mascara is the closes I found to Max Factor."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Adina","Irvine, CA",5,"I work outdoors and in a pool, this mascara looks great and lasts sooo well. A bit difficult to remove but I'm not complaining."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Wendy","Texas",5,"TOTALLY love this mascara! The little lash extension pieces in this rock! You get thicker, longer lashes with one application. I use the black waterproof all the time. Never smears, runs or quits doing its job."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Lena V","Northern California",5,"Really lengthens and fans out your lashes. The waterproof is REALLY waterproof, and will not budge. Love this mascara"
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","rachel","california",3,"Looks natural, but it definitely flakes, even with lash primer and setting spray. I use the one I bought, but probably won't buy another"
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","LuxeLove","Portland, OR",2,"On the plus side this doesn't clump, it applies smoothly, and it gives your lashes a little more length and volume in a very natural way. That part I love. The problem is the waterproof formula. I often wear waterproof mascara in the summer because I'm more likely to get sweaty and my mascara will smudge. I wore this for the first time the other day, checked my makeup before leaving my apartment (about 45 minutes after application), didn't even get sweaty since it was just in the 70's, and when I checked a mirror a few hours later found big mascara smudges on my brow bone. Also, it flaked. This doesn't qualify as waterproof at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Evanna S.","Houston, Tx",4,"I use this everyday between work or school. What's impressive is the lengthening and volumizing ability. It does both very well and actually simultaneously. I purchased it in waterproof for longwaer. It stands up to the test of time. The only thing that bothers me is that it doesn't seem dark enough. The &quot;blackest black&quot; tone is more like a charcoal gray. I find myself still applying more coats to get more pigment. This made me feel like I kind of wasted money. It's an an awesome product but not in line with the big boys of mascara."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Rick","Florida",3,"I would not purchase this product again, it didn't seem to do anything great with my thin lashes."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Annie","Westmont, Il",1,"Did not hold a curl. I only use waterproof for that reason and surprisingly this formula did not work well for my lashes."

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Mom of 2","Chandler, AZ",5,"Like the brush and that it comes in waterproof brand.  Truly delivered length and volume on my lashes."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","MegTheRed","Columbus, Ms",4,"This really lengthens and defines my lashes. Long lasting. It stays quite nicely for those unplanned overnight stays.<br />Unfortunately, it dries too fast, so if you're not quick enough, it can clump together."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Mary","Hot Springs, SD",4,"This is a good product, but it is difficult to remove without makeup remover."

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Firthy5","Arizona",1,"This mascara is horrible. The fibers drop off and poke you in the eyes. It's dry and hard to build. Returned!"

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Lanie","Birmingham AL",4,"Previously, I tried another couple of the Revlon new line of mascaras, and so far this one is the best. I have two to go, because I personally like to give a product more than one chance to wow me. Now, the red cap one was horrific, the pink cap one was pretty decent, and this one is pretty good. I guess the grandbaby done took all my pretty because I have thin, short lashes now, so anything adding would be good. This mascara is probably going to be good for daytime, because it doesn't (for me) give that oomph you want for a night out. But then again, sparse is my deal! It does give a good definition, and a nice fringe of lash, this is with one good application. I tried a second coat, but it really didn't do that much more. Unlike other reviewer's statements, it did NOT flake on me, so that's a big plus. It is a drier formula, and does not really live up to the shiny-black-lashes it claims, but you know, I like this one!"
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Rjh Texas","Frisco TX",1,"Definitely smudges above the eye. Used it twice then threw it away. That's what I get for trying to save money. You get what you pay for. Went directly back to my IT Super Hero mascara."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Carrie","Illinois",1,"I have to put on 5 or 6 coats before I can even see that I have any on! Worse than mascara from the Dollar Tree."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Ava","Cranston, RI",5,"My eyelashes have trouble holding a curl and this product is the only mascara that actually holds the curl 24/7."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Ariz","Dallas, Tx",1,"This product cut some of my eyelashes in half. I noticed little thick hairs on the wand every time I would put the mascara on. At first it thought it was the mascara bristles pulling out, so I switched the wand and dipped a different wand from a different mascara into the Revlon container...used it on my eyelashes again and saw the same results. It was definitely ripping my lashes in half! Oh and it clutters, would not recommend."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Shop","Atl, Ga",3,"Not clumpy but not very bold or dramatic"
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Col","Reno",4,"It works good if you don't  have long lashes. A couple of coats and your good to go."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","ktshopper","Minneapolis MN",1,"Adds NO length and extremely little volume. However it does not smudge at all (and I often have problems with mascara's smudging) and it does last."

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541025","Beth","Richmond, VA",5,"I had low expectations for this product but bought it out of curiosity with a coupon. I have to say it's pretty amazing; really boosts the lashes in every way and doesn't clump. It's comparable to my all time favorite Lorac cobra mascara and even looks good/clump-free piled on top of it. Would definitely recommend."
