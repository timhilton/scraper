"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Ali","Nampa, ID",5,"I have been searching and searching for just the right highlighting product. I had tried powders, creams, sticks...this one takes the cake! It is the perfect size for getting the color exactly right on my cheekbones, but I can still get the smaller areas like my brow bone and nose. The other thing I LOVE about this product is the bronze color. I debated between the more &quot;pinkish&quot; hue, but went with the bronze color and so happy I did. It looks PERFECT on my tanned skin for summer!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Natural look trendy style","Southern Oregon",5,"I am in love with this stick! It's so much easier to apply my highlight precisely and have it last all day. <br />I've always wanted that pretty &quot;cupid's bow&quot; highlight and it never stays because of my Chapstick &amp; lipgloss applications throughout the day but with this highlighter I finally have that stunning look.<br />Tons of compliments"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Sol","nj",5,"so underrated. so glad i found it. couldn't find any reviews on youtube on this product. took a chance and bought it and it is exactly the highlighter I've been looking for, for the right price. I have light sometimes dry skin and it doesn't look chalky at all which has been an issue for others. def. worth a try"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Ceci J","Houston",3,"I use this along my cheekbones and down the bridge of my nose. I was disappointed upon first few applications as the texture seemed clumpy and dragged poorly along my skin, smudging foundation and looking unnatural. I later realized that the texture improved drastically when I tapped the product before patting it into my skin and blending with two fingers and repeating for a few minutes. Despite how nice it looked, it's a lot of work for a highlighter that doesn't last long and leaves only obnoxious glitter after glow fades."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Amber","Gaylord mi",2,"The product color is nice and glides on smooth, it didn't stay on very long. When I purchased the product it would fall out of container. I feel all the reckon products I have purchased here do this."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","jojo","Los Angeles",2,"Drags on skin and moves foundation underneath, not creamy or pigmented enough. Texture is thick and obvious on skin. Pink shade has a strange grey tinge to it (I'm quite pale skinned)."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Rachelle","Sparks, NV",4,"It's nice for light coverage but doesn't do very well with dry skin. It's decent for an over the counter product"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Shay","Los Angeles",2,"Really wanted to try a stick or cream highlighter and it was a toss up between the Maybelliene strobe stick or this. This product swatched well on my hand so I was happy, but that did not translate to my face. It applies well on bare skin but horribly onto foundation. It's streaky and has a lot of drag, i had to try to heat it with the hair dryer to make it glide on smoother. It pulled and dragged off my foundation and looked horrible and would not blend out so it looked like a shiney line on my face. The next day I tried applying before foundation but it just made my foundation sparkly all over and wasn't noticeable in the points I wanted it to be. I like the icy pink color so I gave it 2 stars, good tone for fair, cool skin. the only application I will use this for is my Cupid's bow and in the corners of eyes. Also it is very subtle, so if you like that poppin highlight this isn't for you. Another one bites the dust, to the unused makeup pile this goes! Will try the maybelliene strobe stick as I read it glides on smooth."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Amy","San Antonio, tx",2,"I used this product on top of my bare minerals so that could be the problem but it seemed to rub off my foundation and was difficult to blend. To me it made my makeup look worse and when I went to highlight my nose it totally took my makeup off there too. My boyfriend even commented on how it didn't look good :( would not buy this product again"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-instafix-highlighter-stick?productId=xlsImpprod14321029","Jessica","Placentia, CA",5,"I put this on under my eyes (I don't have dark undereye circles) and use it as a primer. It is so pretty! It adds a beautiful glow to my look without looking unnatural. I really do love it, it looks amazing!"
