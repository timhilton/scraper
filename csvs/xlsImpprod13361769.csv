I've been using this mascara for over a year with no issues! It's not the best lengthening or volumizing mascara, but it does a good job without going everywhere."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","E","Fort Worth, TX",4,"I love that this is an all in one. Dislike that it often clumps when applying and I have to separate the lashes."

My eyelashes are the most important part of my makeup routine and this is my favorite mascara I've used. My eyelashes look amazing!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Jen","Houston",1,"This product is horrible. The product does lengthen lashes, but your lashes get clumped and it looks fake. The mascara makes your lashes feel stiff, like they will break any second. The bristle is small and doesn't work. Overall, I would not buy again."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Kathy","Chicago, IL",1,"I truly believe that Revlon cannot make a good mascara.  Forget this one.  It looks like you have no mascara on, you cannot layer it, it doesn't volumnize or lengthen.  A waste of money."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Lanie","Birmingham, AL",4,"So I gave this a bad review a while back, and I have come to a drastic change of opinion. Back in the day, the brush had a raisin-shape, oval and flat at the same time, with a reservoir to hold/distribute product. A good idea, but the logistics didn't work, for me anyhow. So I found some in another retailer, and bought one for my daughter and she popped it open and immediately noticed the brush. See, she was in the last episode of Me and My Mascara, and she had the same issues. Well now the brush is kinda football-shaped and it works exponentially better as I have Short-Sparse Syndrome. I am now in love and let Revlon know it. This is good!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","TS_92","Kutztown, PA",1,"I wanted to like this product. I thought that if I used it enough, I'd warm up to it. It may be the worst mascara I have ever used. The brush doesn't separate your lashes. It's like applying mascara using your fingers &ndash; the brush just has absolutely no grip because the bristles (which also break off) are so small. The formula is also a strange consistency of goopy and runny. Don't buy this."

It worked okay, nothing special. It did clump quite a bit. It felt nice when it dried at 8am, but by 2pm my lashes feel gross, waxy and oily like. By 5pm it's flaking off and of course getting in my eyes which causes irritation. Would not buy this mascera again. I've been using it for 3 weeks and debating on just throwing it out."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Clo","Seattle",2,"The packaging and the exterior of the product is actually one of my favorites but the applicator is too small. This  means that you have to do multiple brush strokes to get a good amount of product and it ends up looking clumpy. The product itself is okay and easy to wash away but it seems like you are paying more for the exterior than the brush and the product."

Goes on without clumps, gives you nice length and volume. However, WHO thought that tiny nonexistent brush was a good idea? A bad addition to an otherwise good product."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","CathMH","Grand Rapids, MI",1,"I tried this mascara on four different occasions and regretted it every time.  The brush is small and easy to control, but there is a ton of product on it.  My lashes all stick together.  No added length or volume...unless you count my 5 fat eyelashes that I try to comb apart.  I wouldn't recommend this product and threw it away."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","obsessed with mascaras","alabama",5,"Let me preface this by saying that, for ME, &quot;one coat&quot; is pulling the wand out and using the brush until there's really no formula left. With that being said, this mascara provides intense, thick, long, and extremely curled lashes after only one coat. I don't use an eyelash curler and this mascara curled my lashes so much that they were practically pointing straight up. It does dry relatively quickly but that doesn't bother me because I don't start on my other eye's lashes until I'm completely done with the first one, and I also don't delay between coats. I seriously didn't expect the result. I will say, I absolutely despise the size of the wand, it makes putting on mascara an even lengthier process than it already is."

I was not a fan though, anything that refers to itself as &quot;ultimate&quot; I presume is going to be amazing..... The product did nothing to lengthen or add volume to my lashes. I prefer the Ulta brand of volumizing mascara.  However I tried it due to the coupon."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","sandraz","Chicago",4,"I bought this product because I received a coupon to try it for $4 (from Walgreen's). I use Chanel Le Volume mascara because I have very fine thin short lashes. I refuse to pay $20+ for a mascara primer. My lashes are definitely thicker in the summer time but Chicago winters are cold and my lashes seem to be thinner so I need a little extra help even with high quality mascara. This mascara does do that for me, I use it first as a primer then build my Chanel mascara on that and sometimes even go back to Revlon for some added definition. So for me, the small brush and the formula works well. And is much cheaper than primer. I gave it 4 stars because I just started using it and I want to see how it holds up over time."

The brush is so small and the formula so wet that it smeared all over my lid even with careful application, which took forever with such a teeny, tiny brush. I can't express enough how disappointed I was in this product."

Don't know if they still make it as I cannot find it at my usual stores any more. So I tried this new Revlon mascara and do not like it at all. Doesn't give any volume and it clumps."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Hana","WA",4,"Contrary to most of the reviews, I really like this mascara! I was hesitant to use such a small brush with such short bristles, but I am pleasantly surprised with its performance. This mascara darkens, defines and volumizes my little Asian lashes. I do have to do a comb-through between each layer for a little separation, but I have to do that with 90% of mascaras I use."

Would not use this again. Don't spend your money on this mascara."

The small wand makes for really precise application and as far as clumping, as with any other mascara, you may have to wipe off excess product in the want before applying. It is great at lengthening and separating my lashes. A total WIN!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","mom_of_2_79","Edgerton, WI",1,"I was so excited to try this product based on the most of the good reviews I found.  I have never found a revlon mascara that worked well, but I saw they had a whole new line and thought I would give it a try.  The concept of the mascara is nice, and the wand does seem to get those hard to reach lashes.  I had an issue with too much product on the wand and my wand bristles had strange little fibers that I had to pull off before applying.. Once I tried applying it, the mascara got on my eyelids and even on my contact in my eye.  I dont know if I got a bad mascara, but it did not work out for me at all.  I just bought it yesterday, so I am going to see if I can return it and go back to something else."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Mel","Twin Cities, MN",2,"When I first put it on, I liked the length and volume it gave.  It has small fibers which add to your lashes.  BUT... It flakes off badly onto my cheeks, so much worse than any other mascara I've tried, and after only a few hours.  By the end of the day, there isn't any left on the lashes.  Maybe if I kept applying it periodically throughout the day, but its not worth it.  Also, the hollow brush holds a lot of extra clumpy product, it is difficult to apply without smudging your lash line with clumps of mascara.  The bristles on the brush are incredibly short, which is why you need to be very precise.  Great idea, not good finished beauty product."

I have used Revlon products in the past and I have never been disappointed until now. This is the absolute worst mascara I have ever used, which is saying something because I enjoy trying new kinds of mascara and I seldom buy the same one twice. For starters, it clumps, big time, I always spent several minutes separating my lashes, which had to be done very quickly because this stuff dries super fast. The wand comes out with an excessive amount of mascara on it and the more you try to thin it out, the worse it seems to get. It is very stubborn to remove, it flakes a little, and it's very sticky, it reminds me of Elmer'so school glue.  I would not recommend this to anyone. I used it for 2 weeks, and it never got better. The only positive thing about it is, it is affordable. Overall, it's a total nightmare."

I tried it so many different ways, I tried it warm, I tried it room temp, I washed the brush, I swiped the brush, I used a mascara comb, I asked my daughter to try it and she is a genius at making unwieldy things work and she could not make it do right. So then I GAVE UP! I would not make my worst enemy use this. It sticks, it is difficult to get a good sweep of product because it clumps all over to where I have like three huge lashes. If I'd wanted to look like Betty Boop I'd have gone to my great-grandma's Vaseline + lampblack. Revlon.....you only have one job: make good makeup. DO BETTER."

After using a lash brush to get these out  I went about my day, only to see that the mascara was flaking off.  Glad I didn't pay for it.

The idea of a tiny brush was a good start, as it does indeed reach those hard-to-reach inner- and outer-corner lashes without smudges on your lids, but the hollow core has too much product, and the bristles are either too short or too spaced-out, so it doesn't separate lashes. I ended up with my lashes being clumped into 5 thick lashes. Not a good look. Maybe the more specialized ones in the collection that will be coming out later will be better...?"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Kate","Ohio",2,"First thing I noticed was that the brush is very odd. I've tried the mascara 3 times now and I think I've decided that it's too much stress and work to apply daily. I'm a very natural girl when it comes to makeup but for work and going out mascara is a must have. I think it's a very important part to any makeup routine. <br />With that said, this let me down. Yes the mascara gave me volume.. but that was mainly due to multiple lashes sticking together to look like one. That was a huge problem I had, lashes bunched up together. I was satisfied with the length it gave my lashes but I couldn't get over the appearance of overdone stuck together lashes. With work (a lot of work) I could sometimes pull the lashes a part but that added an extra 10 minutes or so that I don't have time for. <br />I may try again with this mascara for a night out&hellip;. when it's dark, but I will never wear this for work again. <br />I'm also thinking about trying my favorite mascara brush (which is running out) in this mascara to see if it's just the applicator brush that sucks."

It is sticky from the fiber in the product.  It didn't give me lash length, and it became so clumpy that I had to use a separate mascara to separate my lashes. I was very disappointed."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Gwenifer MUA","Atlanta, GA",1,"This brush is bizarre. It's like a little triangle and because the plastic bristles are so small they are worthless. The mascara comes out of the tube thick and goopy and unless you were to wipe the brush with a tissue before applying- which you should not have to do- it just goes on so thick and your lashes stick together. I had to go back over this with another mascara to separate and remove the excess."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Andi","Richmond, Va",3,"The brush on this particular formula (red cap) of mascara is so tiny. It's about half the length of an average wand and 2/3 the width. If you have small eyes I suppose this will be great for you, and if you like a natural style this would be right up your alley as well. But the size of the brush makes getting any length, volume or really any noticeable results a time consuming affair."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361769","Chandra","Oklahoma",5,"I was looking to decrease my makeup budget a bit and replacing $20+ tubes of mascara once a month seemed like a good place to cut back. This one caught my eye and I am so thankful it did! I have tried a LOT of mascaras and this one is the only one I would buy twice. It's the only mascara I can still look in the mirror at the end of the day and still be able to tell I have eyelashes. I have straight blonde lashes that even blackened with mascara tend to be pretty invisible because they just go back to straight with most mascara after a short time. This stuff holds my lashes in place after curling and even seems to curl them some on its own if I am in a rush and skip the curler. I often put it on before work, work all day, go to the gym and sweat off every other bit of makeup on my face, then rub my eyes before bed a few times, then forget to remove it and sleep in it. The next morning, it's STILL there... This is the waterproof version, I haven't tried the non-waterproof. On top of all this, my sensitive, watery and dry due to allergies, eyes are not irritated by it in the least. There's a first for everything... So staying power, longer, thicker, curlier lashes as well as actually being able to wear it for more than five minutes. I think I am sold for life... I'm definitely going to have to try the other ones in this line!<br /><br />Tip: Make sure to wipe off the excess on the brush or it will clump. Especially off of the tip of the brush..."
