"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Happy Chappy","Kentucky",5,"This item was on sale at a local store so I decided to try one of the quads with browns and I LOVE it! It's very gorgeous, lasts all day long, has some shimmer but isn't glittery or little girl looking. I use it everyday and will be buying other quads to try!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","AGE","Raleigh, NC",5,"Although it isn't an expensive shadow, it performs very well.  Great neutrals, applies easily and stays on."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Anonymous","New Orleans, Louisiana",4,"Bought the &quot;Addictive Intoxiquant&quot; quad. It is a very good neutral/natural look for the day. I have used Revlon Colorstay quads for several years. I used to use &quot;In the Buff&quot;, but evidently it has been discontinued. I loved the &quot;In the Buff&quot; eyeshadow quad. It was the best - such beautiful colors - absolutely perfect. Wish Revlon would bring it back."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Tonya1026","Charleston, WV",3,"I purchased this because I was in need of eyeshadow in brown shades. When using this product the colors do not look the same color on my eyes as they do in the compact."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Shammu","Houston, TX",4,"I used a primer and it did not crease.  Color went on easily and stayed true.  Not too sparkly, just a shimmer.  Use your own brush--the sponge is small."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Amy","Portland, Oregon",3,"Honestly, I am a huge fan for eye shadow. I was wanting the seductive kind for the spring season and I don't have purple in my makeup collection. It has good colors, but honestly thought the lighetest color on there was too powdery. It flakes right off when you swipe to put it on and it gets everywhere, I get dissatisfied when that occurs. I also wish the diagram in the back was a little clearer. Good color, but not sure I'd buy this again."

There wasn't much color to begin with after I applied it (trying multiple times, and multiple coats didn't help much either), and after only about 4 hours, it had already faded, creased, and I just looked like I had glitter all around my eyes."

I have a lot of eye shadows and love to play around with different colors.  These however did not go on easily and the colors were not true to form.  When I returned them at the store they said the same thing that this product was difficult to work with.  I would not recommend."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Ruppy","East Lansing, MI",1,"I had bought &quot;Goddess&quot; in hopes of getting a smokey look with a slight feminine touch of pink.  The color looked great in the palette and had a nice shimmer.  <br /><br />However, when I went to apply the color, barely any had shown up.  Even the black color for the creases was only a light grey.  The colors don't blend well and they crease easily.  As if that wasn't bad enough..the poor quality makeup is also really hard to try and remove."

I used it twice once with out a primer since it states it has one already, then once with a primer hoping to get a longer effect. Nothing helped. It still faded and creased in a very short amount of time. I returned the product!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","T","NJ",5,"I bought the Decadant and Precocious quads because I have hazel eyes and like to wear pink, purple, and brown makeup. These colors work very well with my eyes and I think the Revlon quads are a great way to get multiple colors without spending a ton of money. I usually just use two colors from the quad at once. If I use three or four colors I feel like a clown. I'm really fair-skinned with strawberry blonde hair, so tons of eye color doesn't work for me. I like to keep it simple. The color lasts all day! I was so excited about that because I have used other shadows that tend to wear off by lunch time. I work in an office so I'm not sweating or super active all day, but this makeup lasts! It does rub off easily, (ask my boyfriend with the purple smear on his shirt...), but that isn't really a surprise. I will definitely keep buying these quads. Hopefully next time I need makeup the one with the green will be in stock"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Mamasita","Orlando, FL",5,"Worth it!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Meag","MA",3,"This is just your average eyeshadow compact. It comes with two wands- one that's a normal tip and the other that's more of a pointed tip. Was slightly disappointed the first few times I've put it on. I found the colors in the pallet didn't blend well. The purple came out more of a gray. Wasn't totally crazy over this shadow, but it's just your run of the mill makeup product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Bleuschat","Hillsboro, OR",1,"Revlon, Revlon, Revlon- what were you thinking? You took a 5-star product that only needed a bit of updating (new colors and new packaging) and you ruined it. The new formula is awful! The shadows don't stay on a brush or sponge, and most of it ends up on your cheeks or in your eyes, not on your lids. The frosts are now the glitter type which causes irritation, especially to contact wearers, and you left out some of the better color combinations (like Gems &amp; Jewels, for instance). I bought three, but all three are going back. The new compact is sleek and beautiful, but do us all a favor and put the old formula in them instead."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","lovesmakeup","Buckeye, AZ",3,"This eyeshadow is good for the price. It's cheap but isn't too bad for everyday use. I bought a few different colors and I've only used one so far, it was the blushed wines. It went on fine but it isn't very pigmented. I had to apply it a few different times for the color to show up good. But it did stay on and didn't wear off. Over all for a basic shadow I like it. Not something I would wear going on a date or out for the night. But for work or everyday use it's good."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Sue","Cleveland Ohio",5,"Shimmering but not too fancy"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Happy M","Texas",4,"I think this is a great natural palette for the price I got it (50% off that time). Has light, medium, dark brown tints and the odd pink-- all you need for a natural look, especially when you aren't picky, have little time, or not used to wearing eye make-up. It also doesn't feel heavy and I like how they all look combined eg. it's very subtle but on certain angles when turning your face, it pops up before going mellow again. Classy, everyday look. <br /><br />It comes with two eye sponges that you can't initially see inside the packaging (on thick, one thin) and that's the only thing I can say that doesn't feel comfy during application because they're too small (the handle). nevertheless, good for on-the-go and just-stuff-in-the-bag situations. The case is lightweight, black, matte plastic. while people may consider this cheap, I am thankful because it doesn't weigh much. but that's me."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Sveva35","Oklahoma City, OK",4,"I've bought this product several times and am not disappointed in the colors and coverage...wish it would last longer, the color putters out before the end of my work day or needs reapplying, but cannot have everything for under $7 a compact!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Bleuschat","Hillsboro, OR",5,"I have used OT Shadow since it first came out, and while I flirt with others, I always go back to it. My #1 color combo (this week) is Gems &amp; Jewels. I use the lighter colors for day and vamp it up with the darker at night. Unfortunately, it is being discontinued, so I guess I will have to stock up on it for life."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Dancing J","Cary, NC",5,"This is the 2nd one of this type that I've purchased.  I liked how pigmented it was, it's as good as my Bobbi Brown eyeshadows for a fraction of the cost.  So, if you actually want some color without layering a dozen times this is the shadow for you!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Eye shadow girl","Richmond VA",5,"This is a great eye shadow for everyday and evening wear.  Goes on easily, can blend and create a variety of shadow effects, because of the variety of colors.  Highly recommend this product!"

We could see into the container that a corner of one of the colors had disintegrated so I got a 10% discount for it because it was the only one in stock in that color and I have used this product before and liked it.<br /><br />Then when I got it home, I found the sponges smashed and dry.  Two days later the lid fell off.  I will be taking this product back because of old packaging.  <br /><br />I really liked this product in the past but now I am not so sure."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Sabrina","LA",5,"I bought it just before summer and I love the turquoise, teal, peach combo. Little did I know it would become a staple. I have blue-green-gray eyes and I've been lining them with turquoise or teal; I just top the liner off with the corresponding powder and it stays like a pro and enhances the color of the liner. Or, I can do smoky for evenings out. Very versatile. I also love the peachy color as an overall lid shade to bring out my baby blues. Great bargain purchase!"

When I got home I realized the compact I picked up at the store was broken. I took of the sticker that sealed it and the entire top popped off because it was broken, but I exchanged it easily the next day. Hopefully it was a fluke and the cases don't break that easily. Anyway, great colors for everyday wear."

I've been trying to learn how do to eyeshadow properly, with the darkest shade in the crease, midtone on the lid, and highlight on the browbone, and I don't feel like there's enough variation within the individual compacts to pull that off. Using them together works, oddly enough.<br /><br />That being said, this is the first pressed eyeshadow I've bought in years (was using loose minerals) and the quality of the product is great.

However, in my experience this shadow was not easy to blend without either becoming uneven in distribution on the eyelid or without wiping off the other color from the quad that was previously applied. All of the colors tend to fade or otherwise come off the lid quite easily, even when using a high quality primer. I wanted to like this product but I was ultimately dissapointed.

I seriously bought blushed wines in the old formula about nine times because I kept using it up, and sandstorm was amazing for neutrals... but these... oh my goodness, just save your money.  I bought addictive and precocious because I thought between the two I could make up for blushed wines.  NO.  AWFUL. It's just a glittery mess.  What the heck is with the white and silver colors?  They don't do anything but leave a bunch of glitter on your face.  Not just your eyes.  Your entire face.  I have great brushes.  Tried to apply this three different times, and every time wound up with a too-dark glittery mess.  Waste of money.  And no, it's not my application that's bad-- I'm a trained makeup artist, I know how to apply makeup and believe me I tried to not make this a waste of money.  But that's all this was.  UGH."

I use a cream shadow as a primer and these shadows blend easily and last all day without creasing. If I don't use a primer the colors are less intense and last several hours. I love the convenience of only having to use one quad to create a quick look for work. I bought 'sun swept'for the soft teal, 'goddess' for the pink and 'decadent' for a deeper neutral look. Each quad has a highlight and crease color too that coordinates so I don't have to fuss. The are some satiny shimmers but not too much for my mature eyes."

I' have the Adventurous palette and I love it. It looks good with jeans during the day while shopping, good when I wear it with dresses for special occasions and if I layer it, it looks sexy for going going out on a date. You can control how much you apply to make it look natural or layer it as I said for a more dramatic look. I love a more expensive brand but it runs at $20 per color for eye shadow and this is the only brand I've found that lasts all day and doesn't crease at all."

When it arrived, the colors weren't true to the photo here, but that's the risk I take with online shopping. When I went to apply it, the shadow had almost no pigmentation at all- even the darkest color was just a sheer dusting. I applied a few layers hoping to build up the color, but all it resulted in was a bunch of dusty fallout on my cheeks and in my eyes. Ouchie. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends or colleagues, but I did recommend it to a coworker whose 13 year old daughter is just starting to get into makeup. My coworker is worried about her daughter over-doing it, so I figured she would be safe with this palette. I hear the other shade options can be more pigmented... Maybe I just got a dud!"

It needs primer to stay put, and will leak even then, as it needs to be layered on like cement.  It wears off if you even think about physical activity.  Don't bother with this product."

I own it in &quot;asure mist&quot;, which consists of a whitish-blue, a light blue, a medium blue, and a black. my favorite part was how well the colors created a complete look! all the colors had a subtle blue undertone that made the look overall very cohesive. you can use just the whitish-blue, light blue, and medium blue for a fun look that you can wear everyday or going out, or incorporate the black for a smokey look. My only problem with this quad is that that shadows don't last that long, and the light colors tend to fade. other than that, pretty good!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Sammy C.","Raleigh, NC.",2,"I personally didn't like this product. It had really pretty colors, but they weren't very pigmented. They had a lot of fallout, even if you tried to use your fingers instead of brushes. For the time I spent trying to make them work, then it comes off in an hour is not acceptable for me. They did blend fairly easily and initially felt very smooth. But it had no pigment and it just wasn't there. It also irritated my eye. My eyelids and eyeballs  were red and dry for 2 days. No exaggeration. I did want this product to work because I really liked the color scheme, but recommend purchasing this product."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-16-hour-eyeshadow?productId=VP10281","Always the Accountant","Texas",2,"I purchased this shadow compact in the Romantic shades. I applied first with a skin-toned base and could barely see much of a difference between any of the colors except the blue shade. Even the blue that looks so gorgeous applies very faintly, even after layering it on multiple times. On my other eye I applied the shadows over a white base and while the colors were a little more visible, it was just too much work. It took numerous layers and because there is so much fallout I ended up with glitter bits all over my face. I really had high hopes for these shadows but in the end I decided to redo my eyes before heading out because I was worried the color wouldn't last all day. I normally use a combination of high end and more economical products and found these shadows to not be worth their cost."

It lasts all day even if you touch it, and has a soft color. It looks so natural and each color compact compliments a different eye color. It comes with a quality sponge-on-a-stick (though I just use my finger) and a compact with application instructions on the back. For those of you with blue/ blue-Grey eyes(like me), try the color set called &quot;Wildflower&quot;. Use it with the instructions ad it is amazing!"

It always applies well and stays on all day.  It's a very good eyeshadow for being cheaper.  I am always happy with it.  <br /><br />I do have to state though that it can look a little heavy if you're not careful.  I wear glasses so I have a hard time applying eyeshadow sometimes and it comes out a little darker than I would like sometimes.
