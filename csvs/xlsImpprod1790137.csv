"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Sara","Birmingham, AL",4,"I just got this product, and I'm really gald I did! I have super-pale skin and most powders make my face a shade darker than my neck. This product is the perfect shade for my skin and blends well, however it probably will look chalky on darker skin tones. I noticed it did start to settle in creases and wear off slightly after a few hours, so reapplication is needed.<br /> I actually liked the slight sparkle, I felt it gave my skin a nice dewy glow... but I can see how it could be an issue for some. If you hate the sparkles but otherwise like the product, I recommend Revlon's ColorStay powder in the translucent shade (it's basically the same minus the sparkles)."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Tray","Charlotte, NC",5,"This stuff is great! It helps control my oily skin throughout the day better than anything else I have tried so far and the translucent color is perfect for if you get a little darker with self tanner like I am using now it still works"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Jkline72","San Francisco",4,"I use this to set my under eye concealer. It works well into making it stay although I do feel like it does settle into the fine lines though after several hours but it does give you face a super soft finish that is nice"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","smj","Angola, IN",4,"this is a great finishing product--- I've spent alot more and have the same results with your product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Lauren","Vancouver, WA",1,"Bought because I needed a matte translucent finishing powder, it doesnt say anything about freaking sparkles!!!! I put it on and It looks greasy and sparkly and ewww. So not good."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Aimi","PIttsburgh",5,"This is without a doubt the best powder I have ever used. Controls shine because it sets the makeup so well. No change in color on skin - perfect!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Photoreadyskin","Ohio",5,"I bought this in hopes that it would help cover acne and dark spots left behind by acne, and I'm happy to say that it works wonders. I use a very small brush to tap a bit of this powder on problem spots only(to set the foundation I use first to cover any acne/blemishes). The shimmer in it is too much to use all over your face-just for blemishes.  I have very pale skin and when I do get a blemish it's very noticeable, until I use this to conceal it. And do people really expect the applicator that comes with any makeup to be great?  Come on."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","nat","los angeles, ca",1,"personally didnt like this<br />it was sparkly, which i hated<br />it caked onto my skin<br />i suppose if your only going to use this when your going out and getting dolled up, it will photograph well. but it will make you look much whiter in pictures, so i recommend using a darker foundation than your usual color"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","*kennedy*","Kaysville, UT",5,"AWESOME!! It is a natural coat over the top to control shine and seal in your foundation. THANK YOU!! :)"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","lucky815","norridge, il",4,"pretty good.  compact is nice, includes a little brush"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Kaki the Kutie","Escondido, CA",5,"I am fair skinned so I know the translucent powder works on my skin. I like that I can powder it lightly on my face with my big powder brush easily."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","lexi","phoenix,az",4,"I use this when I want an invisible finish. It also helps control unwanted shine from oily skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Honey2800","Land O'Lakes, FL.",4,"I usually go for a more expensive product but I wanted to give this a try. It leaves a lovely matte, soft look. I am getting married Sept.22, 2012, we will see how this holds up to photography.<br />I can tell you it holds up to the Florida heat pretty good."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Nani","Austin",3,"Better suited for people with fair skin and I have told my fair friends to get this product"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Kysha","IN",4,"Use bit as an every day finisher, but i fubd it to be too sparkly."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Erin","Farmington Hills, MI",5,"This is one of my favorite products. I like the sparkles, since it is not applied heavily and it goes all over my face and isn't supper sparkly. I apply with big retractable face brush, which ensures good coverage. The brush included is not very useful. I am very fair and this product is a good shade for me, most powders are not a light enough. As a finisher it is good because it is not white, but a lighter flesh tone."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Erin","Farmington Hills, MI",5,"Love this powder! It is one of my faves. There are some sparkles, but I don't mind it since I don't put it on heavy. I am very fair, and most powders are not a light enough shade, so I don't have to worry about the color being too light. I wear it alone or over foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","kc","ormond beach, florida",5,"saw this recommended in a magazine and wanted to try.  I normally don't like to wear powder foundation but do need something to set my liquid foundation and this is perfect.It gives a nice finished look without being heavy."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Makeup Lover","Denver",4,"Use to set and blend eye shadow!!!!!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Merlynnie","Saint Petersburg, FL",4,"I use this with Bare Minerals instead of the pricey Mineral Veil.  I have also used with Makeup Forever Powder Foundation and Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation.  Controls shine and sets my makeup very nicely.  I'm 45, fair skin and it doesn't settle into any lines I may have.  Stands up well to FL humidity."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Erin","Farmington Hills, MI",5,"I am very pale, so I have a hard time finding makeup that is light enough. I have red hair and green eyes, if that tells you anything! I apply this face powder with a big brush after mineral foundation and it is very natural-looking for me. It does not settle into my creases like most powders. It does have a slight glitter, but nobody is going to notice unless they are right in front of your face."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Sum One","Dublin, CA",3,"I like this highlighter! I use the Revlon ColorStay (dry/normal) and I use this translucent powder to top it off! I actually apply this on top of the highlighter under my eyes and its the perfect last minute touch. Makes my face look brighter and ready for a photo and it captures light well in photos as well! The only real problem I have is that I realized there is glitter in it and I am usually strictly matte. You can't tell unless you look close up but it bothers me a bit. DO NOT put this all over your face, it will white you out. Obviously, it is white in color so its best to accentuate highlighting areas. It does cake up a bit if my skin is feeling particularly dry but I haven't noticed any huge problems. Overall, great stuff for the price!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","CherawGirl","SC",1,"I read good reviews about this but I have mature skin and don't need shimmer/sparkle to highlight age related imperfections.  Had to return it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Sooner Gal","Tulsa, OK",5,"When my beauty blog recommended a finishing powder, I found this one and have used it ever since.  It is a true translucent and does not have a chalky finish.  It does just what it says."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Lauren the realist","Greenville, NC",4,"Worked well for what I needed it for!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","thill","North little Rock, AR",2,"Translucent powder is great for a technique called baking, a make up practice that helps create a flawless, long lasting make up look. Its supposed to look natural and keep the wearer's skin from looking oily. This powder has sparkles in it which, if you've ever had drop down from glitter eye shadow, you'll know how bad sparkles or glitter look on your cheeks and under your eyes. In my opinion any foundation based product should not have sparkles in it because it looks unnatural and will make your skin look oily."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Z","Colorado",4,"I like this translucent powder for setting my under eye concealer and it does prevent it from creasing on you. However, I usually will go for a very natural look and this powder has just too much sparkle in it. If you're going for a natural look then this probably won't be for you."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Teresa","State College, PA",4,"I would buy this again."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","......","Ogden, UT",4,"I have very fair skin so it's hard to find a powder that is light enough, but this works/looks great! I will definitely be buying this powder again!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Outdoor Girl","Waukesha, WI",4,"My old translucent powder is no longer on the market so I tried this one.  Covers well, not cakey, doesn't add a pasty appearance.  Works great as a finishing powder over foundation or alone over sunscreen to even out skintone and minimize pores.  My only complaint is that it has a bit of shimmer to it, but not a lot."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","LC","America",3,"I tried this against No7 Perfect Light Loose Powder for about a week. I tried them over concealer on both sides of my eyes, alternating sides incase one eye looks older than the other (not sure if that actually happens). Both are talc based and I've been told that's not good for the skin. Neither were the miracle look I've been looking for. Both settled into the lines beneath my eyes, which I swear I can't see until I start spackling all of this makeup beneath them. No 7 seemed to crease the worst. On the first day of the H2H I immediately noticed I liked better than No7 and I asked a few people which side of my face looked better. I did get rained on and I think No7 faired better than the Revlon but other than that, I thought Revlon had the better product and kept it. My search continues, though. All of these powders seem to sit under my eyes in a slightly more attractive way than if I had powdered sugar on but much less tasty. I bought some talc free options to try."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Kay","Louisiana",3,"It works fine for coverage but DO NOT KEEP APPLYING OR BUILDING. YOU WILL LOOKS LIKE A GHOST! It is NOT TRANSLUCENT! It does have a little shimmer to it which is pretty but after reapplying over oily zones throughout the day I look like a ghost no matter how light I try to apply it. I have used it for setting powder a couple of times which is seems to work well for since it is actually very whitening/lightening when applied in a heavy application."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Cher","Colorado",2,"I didn't like the glitter in the powder. All falls in creases. I stopped using powder."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Kimmer","Lake Elmo",4,"Makes a great almost airbrushed look to my skin.  I use a big fluffy brush so it gets l little messy but otherwise I love it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","KK","Overland Park, KS",5,"I really like this compact for use in my makeup bag.  Very portable without the mess of loose finishing powder."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","jess","Calgary, AB",1,"this is terrible, first of all the name of the product is very misleading considering its not translucent, it shows up white and it has SPARKLES. i desperately needed a setting powder so i bought this in a hurry not realizing there was sparkles. was not pleased with that, highlighter would be a much more appropriate name for this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","melthenurse","los angeles",4,"I have big pores, I shine on my forehead all the time. The powder absorbs the oil and controls my shine as well as set my makeup. I do need to reapply during the day for continued shine control."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","corrine","philadelphia, pa",4,"Great setting powder"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Makeup Obsessed","Philadelphia, PA",1,"I didn't like this at all. It was WAY too white, not translucent. It made me look like a ghost and i have a light to fair skin tone. I didn't like the sparkles it had in it. Overall, the only reason i use it now is to  dust it on over when i look orange because the extreme white color fixes it but it is way too white to be considered a translucent finishing powder. Don't waste your money."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Doctor Proctor","Tennessee",2,"This product is okay.  I'm not really a huge fan.  It doesn't apply all that well, and I have oily skin, and it didn't prevent oil or  set my makeup very well.  It may work for shine control for people with normal to dry skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Sally K","MA",3,"This powder is okay, and what I mean is that it made my face look ghastly! Now mind you I dusted it on very lightly like I usually do with pigmented/foundation powders but it just made my skin look whiter than usual. It controls shine very well though, so as a whole it works like it says it does. Just watch out if your skin falls into the dark medium/caramel range."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Demi","Florida",4,"I have oily skin and I live in a humid climate. This product is awesome. I don't have to keep checking my shine levels like I've always had to do with other products. Best of all, it's lightweight and natural-looking."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","PopTart","Kennesaw, GA",4,"Pregnancy totally changed my skin, but not in the ways I'd hoped.  My pregnancy &quot;glow&quot; was nothing but grease and oil.  It was maddening.  Since then, I've been on the look-out for a budget finishing powder to keep the shine at bay.  This powder works!  It also comes with the perfect, little application brush which works so much better than a sponge or poof.<br /><br />For reference: I layer moisturizer, primer and liquid foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Deev","Ny",5,"This really sets your make up for the day.  My blush or highlighter doesnt move at all. For the price definitely can compete with other high end brands."

I use the Photo Finish foundation and concealer and I love them all. My skin is smooth and looks flawless. It last a long time and does help control oil. This product also helps with break out.

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","BansheeBlue","Las Vegas",3,"I bought this for a movie/photo shoot to use with the Photoready foundation. I was suprised when I applied it that it had a very significant shimmer to it, and also, the application brush was small and plastic, and that made for an uneven and awkward application."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-translucent-finisher?productId=xlsImpprod1790137","Brittkitten","Sacramento, CA",4,"The product does eliminate shine, adds a nice matte look, and it isn't entirely translucent. The product does lighten my face after applying a little, but I have a medium complexion so it doesn't wash out my face completely.<br /><br />I do not like the brush it came with, I only apply this using a thicker brush that has lighter and more secure bristles."
