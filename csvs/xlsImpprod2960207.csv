"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Brittney","Missouri",1,"I got this product cause I needed something new to put over all of the wet stuff I put on! (Concealer, foundation, eyeshadow primer etc.) and this is the worst thing, it settles into your creases and doesn't last all day! That's what aggravated me the most, the color makes your skin look like a ghost!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Katie","Houghton MI",3,"I've tried better at this price. It does a decent job of keeping my make-up in it's place, but it doesn't control shine and it slightly lightens my face's color."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Texas Tea Lady","Houston, TX",3,"This is the only actual plain translucent power that I could find at Ulta. I do not like the case; too much plastic and too large. Not as sleek as other brand compacts."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Boog's Wifey","Tacoma, WA",3,"I was honestly so confused when I received this, it's just a regular pressed compact foundation but there is no pigment in it. It does help control shine but no where on it does it say it's a &quot;finishing powder&quot;. It seems to be helping keep my liquid foundation from sliding or wiping off but just note that it does make you look lighter when you apply it. I follow it up with bronzer since it takes my foundation a whole shade lighter. Probably wont buy it again but worth trying. The compact itself it's rather weird, you open it half way just to get to the product then all the way reveals the small powder applicator underneath. Cool idea, I apply it with a powder brush and get good results."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","TVZ","Minneapolis, MN",3,"I've used the beige color before and liked it so I thought this time I would try the translucent, but it is very visible.  I wasn't expecting it to be completely translucent, but I have to make sure to sweep a brush across my face to remove excess and blend."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","NorahL","New York City, NY",1,"I bought this and I was dissapointed. after just a couple hours it was all blotchy and didnt control oil at all"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Kelli","Michigan",5,"This translucent powder was an impulse buy but I am pleased.  I use it to set my under eye concealer.  Then, after I use my skin tone color powder over my entire face, I set my face with this again.  This controls the oils very well.  My skin is very oily and it keeps it at bay.  I may have to blot after about 4-5 hours of wear which is wonderful."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","M","Virginia",4,"I got this in the lightest color and I wouldn't buy it again in that color.  It looks too pale, which is surprising for me because I'm 99% of the time the palest shade a brand offers.  I would buy it again, but a shade darker. I use a brush to apply rather than the sponge it comes with (which seems to make the color a little more even).  It's a good powder.  It doesn't say that it's oil-free or non-comedegenic so I'd be careful if you're acne-prone."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","greenthumb","draper ut",3,"the compact is stupid the pad is under the product the you have to open it wide to get to it and then wiggle the product back into place to be able to use. size of compact is deceiving on the amount of product you get"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","me","Newnan, GA",4,"love the translucent color option- works for me in all seasons!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Julie","Walnut",4,"I like this powder because it comes in translucent, is oil free and is reasonable."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Maddy","Rochester NY",4,"I use this product everyday and I rarely need a mid day touch up!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","jenab","san antonio tx",5,"This is my first translucent powder, I use it on top of Revlon color stay foundation and I am very pleased. I don't look like a cakey mess it is very nice!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Vanessa","Las Vegas",5,"I have been using MAC products, but find their powder cakey, drying and aging. Not the case here. I love this powder. I usually apply with a brush for light application, but have used the included applicator for a slightly heavier application for a night out. Very happy with it. Does not irritate my sensitive skin, feels silky. And it has a vaguely wonderful smell that smells familiar (cinnamon?) but that I can't place. I know it seems insignificant, but if a product has an unpleasant smell, I really hate using it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Heather","Lexington, KY",5,"This powder is the best I've ever tried...and I've tried higher end ones! Fantastic!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","ZeJesi","Texas",3,"I got this product because I'd ran out of a silca based transparent powder from Wet &amp; Wild. Usually I think the more expensive brands have better quality, and this matched the brand of my foundation so I thought they'd work together great. Sadly, I was wrong. Revlon doesn't seem to know what transparent means, this powder has a pink base, paired with my yellow undertoned foundation it turns me orange. This happens almost every time I try to buy something labled as &quot;transparent&quot;, apparently no one has ever heard of a pale girl with yellow undertones. I'll go back to my $0.99 brand next time."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Tracy","Tucker, GA",1,"This powder is no good!  I bought this to control oil in my t zone. I've been using it for about 6 mths now, and  It does nothing to control shine for anywhere close to 16 hrs! It control shine for about 30 minutes, and then I'm oily agian! It also makes my foundation a shade lighter. I will not repurchase."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Lora","Charleston, WV",4,"I've been lightly using this to set my makeup, and to slightly mattify my t-zone. Dewy is fine, but greasy is not! This has been good. Gives a nice finish without looking cakey or adding texture(I'm sure it might if you used a lot). HG? No, but for now while I'm on a tight budget, I'm happy with it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","MakeUpLovah","Orlando, FL",5,"I use this compact to set my make-up in hopes of controlling shine.  I only use it once in the morning and typically go all day without getting shiny or having to use a compact of some sort.  Great product..only complaint is that I wish it came in a loose powder form!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","farnorcal","far northern california",5,"I've recently realized how many of my friends have NO idea what translucent powders are for...which kinda makes me feel like I know a dirty little secret!  <br /><br />I love this powder.  After applying foundation &amp; concealer, I use a brush to apply this as a setting powder.  Looks good out the door, but I find that after an hour or so, it looks even better.  I was actually shocked by my own reflection - good shocked, for the first time ever (was that really me!?)!!  My skin has never looked better, and it lasted until I took it off - not one touch up, &amp; no creases!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Cam","Pa",1,"I purchased this translucent powder to use for setting my concealer on the recommendation of an ulta employee. I'm disappointed because it's drying, visibly white, and still does nothing to stop my concealer from moving or creasing."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Mads","Portland Oregon",4,"I really like the powder. It goes on great as a foundation setter. It's super light weight and the color matches perfectly for my pale skin."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Cheryl","Salt Lake, UT",5,"I have used other finishing powders and they didnt do anything to help smooth out any issues with the foundation.  this finishing powder is AMAZING! i love it and i will always be using it!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Lexi","Anchorage. AK",5,"I always use after applying foundation, and after my fI'll face of makeup is finished! It works beautifully with my skin!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Sprkly","Elsie, MI",5,"I use a fluffy kabuki brush to apply this over my Revlon Colorstay Foundation and concealer/contour. It feels smooth and silky and honestly controls oil better than any powder, cream or primer I've ever used. My only concern is that for a translucent powder, it does seem an odd color around my jawline. I probably apply too much there, but overall I'm very impressed!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Molly","California",5,"I really love this product. Whenever I use it my makeup lasts so much longer than when I don't, I can absolutely tell the difference. Holy grail setting powder"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Love to smell good!","Huntington Beach, CA",5,"Works better than major expensive brands and I've tried them all"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","JayLove","Oxnard CA",5,"Great setting powder."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Mom and teacher from Sugar Land","Sugar Land, Texas",5,"After not being able to find my normal Covergirl powder, I bought this.  I love that it doesn't add color to my face, it just takes off the afternoon shine that seems to set in around lunch time everyday. I reapplied Covergirl two or three times daily, but I only use this powder once  at mid-day and I'm fine the rest of the afternoon until I get home. I'm glad I stumbled on it- but the last time I looked for it at Ulta it was out of stock!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","mwilson","Indiana",5,"I love this translucent powder! I use it over my TOO FACED Born This Way foundation to set it and it looks beautiful.  It stays on most of the day- was surprised at the results of a drug store brand cosmetic."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Squeaky","raleigh, NC",1,"It was listed as transparent but when I applied it the first time, I looked like I had seen a ghost!  Will be returning this item."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Ruth","California",5,"Seriously the best powder ever! I recommend this powder to anyone who needs a good pressed powder on a budget. It's very finely milled and it good at oil control."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Cheap Cheap the Bird","Candy Land",4,"I am very cheap when it comes to makeup. I will not spend 50 dollars on a foundation or powder to contain my oily skin. I find this works amazing to cover up my very oily skin, highly recommend. More often than not, I do NOT have to reapply throughout the day and will definitely repurchase this again and again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","mcbuttercup91","Florida",4,"This is a great powder but way too light for my skin and I'm pretty pale. I have more dry skin so this isn't perfect for me but I will continue to use it and recommend it to my friends with oily skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Laxgirl17","Toledo Ohio",4,"Just apply after foundation"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Tiffy","Buffalo",2,"I like a powder that looks natural, controls shine &amp; lasts all day. While this powder is excellent in shine control and staying power, it creates a cakey unnatural finish. Usually translucent powders are perfect for my fair skin but this is way too light. Instead of blending in, it sits on top of my skin and looks  like chalk. Going up one color would solve the cakey unnatural color and make this a great powder."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","rariley1437","Washougal, WA",5,"Great product. Eliminates any shines and leaves a smooth, natural finish on your face."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Pumpkin","Birmingham, AL",5,"This is the best powder I have used even compared to department store brands such as Lancome and Estee Lauder.<br /><br />It has great coverage, lasts all through the work day, is fragrance free, and does not turn orange during the day."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Fairest of them all","Bangor, WI",4,"I use this product because it is light enough to match my neck. Once I finish my foundation and concealer I set my face with this powder using a powder brush. It lightens everything and matches my neck!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","CN","Brentwood, CA",5,"It works great"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Renee","Yorkville, Illinois",4,"This is a great product to set your foundation in place. I love it."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Lil bit","Denham Springs, LA",4,"I love how it's a light powder. Makes my makeup stay longer and I use it as an extra highlight!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Jenny","Saint Louis, MO",2,"I put this on top of my liquid foundation to set it and it looked absolutely horrible. I had to take it off of my nose."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","Cas","Chatfield tx",3,"I bought this as a cheap last minute powder for a play my friend and I were on makeup duty for. We were also acting in the play so we didn't have time to do touch ups. The main character was on my list and with some spray he looked flawless even after the play!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod2960207","kiki","kissimmee, fl",4,"so this is great because after putting on my makeup, sometime it looks TOO shiny. this is the perfect touch to tie in the look and make it way more matte. i just wish it lasted ALLLLL day. it lasts for a full work day which is what i need it for, and if not i just apply more if im going out again. for the price, you cant beat it."
