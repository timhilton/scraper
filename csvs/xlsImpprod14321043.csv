"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Amy K","Katy, TX",5,"I really love the felt tip of this eyeliner, I get a bit of a rush every time I use it but I am a make-up geek. I'm in my 20s and my mom liked this so much she bought two the last time we were at ulta. Works for bold and minimalist looks. It's a must have in my makeup bag."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Megan","Charlotte, NC",1,"I usually love anything Revlon Colorstay, but this is awful. The line bleeds like crazy and smudges all over the place after just a couple hours. If my eyes water even the slightest amount, it completely comes off and smudges ALL over. Never buying this again."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","SarahWantsGoodMascara","Dallas, TX",3,"I usually use the Maybelline Master Precise, but I decided to try this since there was a coupon. The master precise liner has a much slimmer felt tip, so I was skeptical this would give me the thin line I like, but I think I like the shorter tip of this liner more. It felt easier to control. The only disappointing factor is that the color fades drastically throughout the day. I went to the bathroom at work around 2 p.m. and wondered if a magic trick happened on my face because I couldn't see my liner anymore. It became a grayish color."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","PittsburghBeauty","Pittsburgh, PA",1,"I needed a replacement for my stila liner (had to buy something similar, but cheaper) and this was a huge mistake. It runs and smudges throughout the day and was so bad that after fixing it several times, I had to just take it off because it wasn't worth it. I don't know how people are giving this good reviews. The color payout is okay. If you're looking for a sharp black, this isn't for you. If you're into dull black liners that you can smudge out with some black shadow, then by all means go for it. I won't be purchasing this again. It's a shame, too, because Revlon products are usually so high in quality."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Mars","California",5,"I've tried a lot of drug store eyeliners before and this is one of my favorites so far."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Makeup Junkie","Indiana",2,"Very disappointed.  I had high expectations after reading multiple reviews on this product. This eyeliner stayed on about an hour and a half before it started to fade then eventually disappear."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Nina11","Orlando, FL",4,"I use this for an everyday look. It can smudge, but it tends to stay on."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Sandy","LA",5,"It's the best eye pen! I've used it for almost 10 years! I've tried other brands and styles but wouldn't change this one."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Raquel","Silver Spring, MD",5,"For such a cheap price compared to other eyeliners, it does the job! It stays where you put it and I'm in love with how smoothly it glides. Perfect for everyday!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Kay","Wimchester",5,"This product is great for the perfect wing"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Domii","Wa.",1,"I love an easy eyeliner that applies effortlessly. The pen itself dries up super easily and causes irritation when I attempt to apply. Honestly not satisfied with this eyeliner at all. Only thing I appreciate about it is its color. Besides that I find this product to be trash. Its hard to apply, smudges easily and honestly makes my 5 min wing job into a 20 minute wing job."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Moll","Pittsfield, MA",5,"I love how easily this product glides on! Some liquid liners seem to drag across my eyelid, but this one goes on very smooth. Would definitely recommend!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Jen","Woodinville, WA",5,"This eyeliner is absolutely amazing!! I have the oiliness skin EVER and it stays PUT through my whole day from 5 am - 5 pm. I ended up buying the Colorstay gel shadow, too, and it's equally amazing. Hardly any crease clumping at all. I'm hooked - I'll never buy another line again!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Kathy","Lee's Summit,  MO",5,"LOVE this eyeliner. It's my favorite...and the only one I buy. I can apply thin to thick lines as needed. Lasts all day and very easy to remove at night. I have had a hard time finding it. So glad Ulta has it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","jai","san francisco",1,"smudges and smears. always leaves black marks on my lower eyelids and non existent on my top eyelid. note that i never wear liner on my lower lid and a very thick line on my upper lids due to having monolids. this sucks. period."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Amommyto2girlz","St.Cloud, MN",1,"It smudges throughout the day and leaves marks on my eyelid. I even asked an associate about the quality prior to buying. All I want is a product to do as it is advertised."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Tewi","Redmond, WA",4,"Like the tip angle, easy to apply with varying thickness."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Raccoon","New York",1,"I was applying this and a tear came out of my eye and the entire thing smudged everywhere. It ran down my face and got in my eyes. I swear you would have thought I was in a horror movie, crying black tears. I must say though that it was very easy removal, no need for make up remover and before my face turned into a freak show, the color was actually very nice."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Hannah Lo","Ottawa, O",4,"This is one of my favourite eyeliners because it is so easy to apply and it stays on all day, however it is not exactly black with is a little annoying but anyway..."

I love that it's like a marker and glides on. It won't smudge easily but washes off without leaving residue. Try it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","A fresh start","denver",5,"Does NOT run or cause raccoon eyes.  How perfect is that.  The Ulta brand pen liner causes raccoon eyes."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Meredith R.","Virginia",5,"I kinda stumbled onto this and am glad I did! It's not exactly like Stila's cult classic liquid liner but it's much closer than the price would suggest. The fluid flows well and freely through the tip, so you can stamp with the side of it for a cat eye, or trace with the tip on the inner corners. It dries almost instantly and stays put all day. I haven't gone swimming or anything with it, but it stays perfect all day in regular working conditions."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Amy","Pittsburgh",1,"This was a complete waste of money.  When I opened the package and took off the top, it splashed out all over my vanity and hands.  Color went on so light and just looked terrible.  I'd rather pay $23 for the Lorac one that actually works than this poor excuse for a liner. So mad I actually tried this when I knew better."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Kennedy","Hagerstown, MD",2,"Dries up after using it for maybe two days. I would usually go get more but it kept doing the same thing... currently looking for another eyeliner that won't do the same"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Rylee","USA",5,"I love this product. Not the best if you like very thin lines. I tend to do a thicker, shorter wing though and it works perfectly for that. I also think it lasts very well and doesn't smudge even with my oily eyelids"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","SaraM","Houston, TX",3,"Accidentally bought this thinking it was the one with the longer and thinner felt tip (similar to the Kat Von D Tattoo Liner).  Give it a try regardless, it went on ok, since the felt tip was a bit thicker, it didn't give me the winged line i would of liked.<br />The claim of 16 hour wear is a lie! 4 hours in and the color was starting to smudge.  I do have hooded eye lids and that is a constant problem when i use liked eye liners that do not have a good water proof formula/ long wear claim. I cringe to think how it holds up in the summer with all the humidity we get down here"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Shyannef","Fairbanks AK",1,"My packaging was bag I guess. When I got home and opened this eyeliner, the liquid was coming out of the top and got all over my hand, I didn't think anything of it until I tried to use it the next day and it got all over my face."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Dee","Florida",4,"Nice eyeliner"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-liquid-eye-pen-classic?productId=xlsImpprod14321043","Taylor","Orlando, FL",4,"I'm a big fan of the Color Stay products. I've been using this eyeliner pen for years. I suspect that they have been changing the formula throughout the years, because it seems to stay on a little bit longer than it did a few years back. The main complaint I have is that it's extremely non-waterproof. I would not recommend using it on your lower eye, maybe even just for doing wings. It does dry up relatively quickly too."
