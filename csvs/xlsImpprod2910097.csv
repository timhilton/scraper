This works! It goes on very easy and has a slight cool feeling like its liquid powder (if that makes sense). I have noticed the slight shimmer but that is what makeup does. the &quot;shimmer&quot; reflects the light to minimize any imperfections in your skin. I have found that you cannot use a different type of concealer or pressed powder with it. I apply my concealer after my foundation and I found that it turned the color of the mineral makeup and got cakey where I had applied the concealer. It does have good effective coverage, but be sure not to use too much as the more you apply the darker your tone will become. I'm almost out so I'm definitely going to buy more. I think it's quicker too than applying a liquid foundation, then concealer, then pressed powder. It doesn't have impressive staying power, however I've heard of a trick of misting hairspray on your face or in the air and then putting your face through the mist that seems to help your makeup last longer. Hope this helps you!"

I found this product to be too shimmery and it didn't spread out well. The L'oreal True Match finishing powder is MUCH better. Also, the brush is terrible, but you should expect that."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","KelseyB","Washington DC",4,"After reading all the reviews on this site and others, I have to admit that I was pretty hesitant about buying this product. Below I'll explain what I was looking for and what I got out of Revlon ColorStay Aqua<br /><br />What I was looking for:<br />Light-Medium coverage<br />Blendable<br />Natural-looking<br />Wont seep into/exaggerate pores and fine lines<br />Possibly a liquid-to-powder foundation<br /><br />What I got:<br />Easy to build coverage<br />SUPER blendable (worn over pure vitamin E oil)<br />Feels AMAZING - cooling, refreshing, moist<br />Looks very natural - dewy yet matte...oh, and the &quot;sparkles&quot; others referred to....not so! It's a very SLIGHT shimmer that I hardly noticed at all<br />Makes my skin look beautiful - pores and fine line...bye bye!<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy. I have used countless mineral foundations always to find that I look &quot;dusty&quot; or powdery...fuzzy even. Not happy with that. This foundation gives me the lightweight feel of a powder with the smoothing perfection of a liquid. I do agree - probably not for people with uneven skin surfaces, acne scars, or those who desire full coverage makeup!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Raye","Southeast Texas",4,"First of all, I consider the brush that is included in the lid to be TRASH.  This may be user malfunction, but I achieve much better coverage by buffing this product on with a kabuki brush.  <br /><br />Anyway, I am very pleased with the lightweight and SPF coverage this product provides!  As a disclaimer, I've recently started wearing makeup in the past year.  However, I've used many  (probably between 10 and 15) powders and mineral makeups.  On days that I do not wear a &quot;full face&quot; of makeup, I wear only this.  On &quot;full face&quot; days, I layer this over my liquid foundation.  It has great coverage and it certainly doesn't scream &quot;Hey, look at me and my makeup mask!&quot; It definitely lets my skin breathe.  I have oily, acne-prone skin and hyperpigmentation on my cheeks.  This product does not break me out and does a great job of soothing/covering my blemishes and bright red patches.<br /><br />My mom, who also has rosacea on her cheeks, actually recommended this product to me.  I couldn't pass it up after hearing her rave reviews!<br /><br />Also worth noting is that I live in a very hot and humid climate.  This product does not make my face itch or gather and drip down my face when I sweat. Yes, I need to touch up after lunch if I apply this in the morning before work.  But that does not upset me, as I've never truly used a mineral makeup that didn't need a little bit of a touch up by the end of the day.  I've tried BareMinerals and was very pleased with it, but not enough to shuck out the cash and quit buying this product.<br /><br />I have used this product for roughly four days a week for a year and have been through three containers. Considering the value and price of this product, I am very pleased!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Molly Wobbles","Minneapolis, MN",4,"I use this product only in places that need extra coverage ie: splotchy skin or zits after I've applied my tinted moisturizer. It is very light and powdery almost bare minerals like- and it's easy to layer the coverage from light to heavy. I'm fair skinned so powder can look fake and noticeable, this one isn't. The brush comes in the top of the cover and its kind of awkward to take it out, shake some powder into the inside of the cover and dab it on where I need it. A little fussy, but it looks like it will last me a long time."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","JETG","California Central Valley",3,"This powder was soft and cool on application but had no staying powder compared to many other similar brands. I would not buy this again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Emi","Omaha, NE",4,"I use it on my eyelids, so my eyeliner stays put &amp; is more long lasting."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Ulta Lover","texas",4,"best i used so far!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Sailtheplains","Monterey, CA",4,"I have extremely sensitive skin. Because of a condition called Lupus, almost all make ups and skin products cause breakouts, scarring and extensive facial peeling that leaves my skin red and raw. I've tried countless brands and different products. I had been recommended to try the Bare Minerals line but then I happened to see this Revlon mineral powder--obviously for about a quarter of the price.<br /><br />I decided to try it. So far, it feels nice when I put it on--soothing--though it does seem to take more than other powders to get the coverage you want. But you also get more powder in the little case. I haven't had a big problem with the makeup peeling off (taking my skin with it)--so this may be the one that I end up sticking with. <br /><br />It was a little difficult to skin match but it blends pretty well. I would recommend it for others that have skin sensitivity problems."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Jonesy7","Cleveland, OH",5,"Love this foundation! I used to use Maybelline Mineral Foundation and I found that it made my face itch when I got hot. This foundation is like a dream! You can feel it go into an almost liquid form as you blend it into your skin. It's light, easy coverage without the messiness of a liquid foundation or the dryness of a powder!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","KARRIE","GRIFFITH, INDIANA",4,"wORKS VERY WELL FOR ME."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","ShoeJunkie","Lafayette, LA",2,"This product was recommended on a blog as a &quot;drugstore dupe&quot; to the BareMinerals foundation, and was said to offer great coverage over uneven skin tone and blemishes. I do not find this product to offer much coverage, and it does not stay on well without a foundation primer. It's not a great &quot;dupe&quot; and I would rather splurge the $30 for the foundation I know will offer great coverage, no fail."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Bratty Catty","Kansas City, mo",5,"Easy to apply and feels great. Not heavy or greasy."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","gabbygail","Salt Lake City, UT",1,"This mineral powder feels amazing as you apply it.  It really feels like water.  Unfortunately, it has hardly any coverage and leaves way too much of a shimmer on your face.  If you have flawless skin, then this is the powder for you.  If you have anything that you want to coverup, then this is not for you."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Rosie","Santa Rosa",5,"I love the feeling of the moisture in the product. Doesn't last as long as I would like."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","mama","Orlando, FL",4,"This powder is very light and blends very well so it doesn't leave you with a caked on feeling. Although it's very sheer I am able to add more powder on the tip of the brush to  conceal any blemishes when necessary. The only problem I've had is having the brush unhinge while in use thus popping back into the plastic casing. I am able to overlook that because I love the texture of the powder, but it's a little annoying."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","FrenchieSally","Dallas, TX",4,"I have been using this powder for a while and really love it.  It is easy to apply, not much of the product is needed, and it is long-lasting.  One thing I really love about it is the cool touch the powder has when it hits my skin, almost like it is wet.  The coverage is light, but enough to give my skin a flawless look."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","jude","appleton,wi",3,"Like the idea to be faster than the  normal way I use a foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Dani Harris","st george UT",5,"I use this everyday and it is the only product that doesn't clog my pires. The makeup loves my skin and it shows it looks very natural  without looking like I have a ton of makeup on."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Elizabeth","Hallandale Beach, FL",4,"I love this loose powder foundation because it covers well, looks natural, and doesn't cake or show lines, etc. It is very easy to use, and lightweight.<br />It is also kind to my skin; doesn't clog pores and is very lightweight.<br />Since it is a loose powder, it can be a bit messy. I always put it on while standing in front of my bathroom sink. that way any loose trails fall into the sink. Maybe I just use a little too much! haha! Touch-ups are a breeze, too.<br />I prefer to use my full-size brush to apply this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Robin","Albuquerque, NM",5,"I love this product. It's as good as any expensive powder plUs its moisturizing. It feels damp when it goes on but dries quickly."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Tabby T","Charlotte NC",5,"I love this loose powder over foundation....it leaves you with a flawless finish... And it stays on throughout the whole day. Try it you will love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Sabrina","Conroe, Texas",1,"This did not cover skin imperfections. I am very disappointed. I purchased this instead of Bare Minerals. Huge mistake."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","C Gro","Dallas TX",5,"Once I started using this particular mineral makeup, I don't want to use anything else."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","PinkGirl212","Atlanta, GA",2,"It feels really neat but not good coverage. It looks splotchy."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Jen","Wilmington NC",5,"This product is the best on the market of it's type . It has a refreshing light and natural feel."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Rach","Phoenix, AZ",3,"This doesn't offer much coverage and it doesn't stay put. I love the liquid makeup and thought that this would be like the liquid in a mineral form. It's not. I will use it for hot summer days when I will be outdoors and just need a bit of coverage to even me out."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Great Dane","Apex",4,"like other mineral makeups for full coverage you have to apply several layers and I have not found a primer from revlon so I have to use bare minerals foundation primer which is a much more expensive line of makeup... Wish I could find a primer by Revlon that would be more cost effective."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Banda","Dallas, Tx",1,"I use my own brush to apply rather than the small danky brush they give you. I actually use that brush to help blend my concealer into the foundation. It has an awesome refreshing feeling once it is on your skin. But everything else suck, its messy, horrible for a going out look. It's got a natural look which i like, but it doesn't last long."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Redsavvy729","Oregon",1,"I was trying to find the Revlon Colorstay foundation (I love that stuff!) but could only find this in the stores. It looked similar except the &quot;Aqua&quot; part so I figured I'd try it. First impression: it feels so refreshing on the skin, but the coverage is very inconsistent. I have fair skin and my skin is splotchy without any make-up on, so I need something that goes on evenly. It also feels dry and looks cakey within hours after application, which I hate. And lastly, it doesn't work well with bronzers. The more &quot;layers&quot; of this stuff I'd put on to try and even it out, the less bronzer would stick to my face, resulting in a zebra stripe effect. Very strange. I've been wearing makeup and buying products for 20 years and this is possibly the worst product I've ever tried on my face. Hate it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Simple Jack","Glendale, AZ",1,"When I first applied I thought the brush was wet but soon realized that was the product.  I didn't have a problem with that, it actually felt good.  But the coverage was non existent and my skin looked worse by mid day than if I hadn't worn makeup at all.  Not liking this stuff at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","turquoiselover81","Ontario, CA",5,"This powder is absolutely easy to apply &quot;if&quot; you have the right brush to apply it with. Its has a light-weight coverage that leaves your face feeling refreshed at the same time giving you a natural smooth finish!! I also use the ColorStay Mineral Mousse foundation before apply this. If you are looking for a thicker/heavier powder to cover up  imperfections, this isn't for you. I love, love, love this product!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Jan","Hoover, Al",2,"I would not recomment this to a friend because the container is too small and it's a very small amount for the money.  Too pricy."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","mandeerg","salem, or",3,"i did not like this...it has too much shimmer in it and the coverage was to light for me. it feels wet to the skin which feels super weird but pretty cool to lol thats really my only positive."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Bellie","San Antonio Texas",5,"It goes on smooth and does not crease on wrinkles.<br />Covers even on dark spots. I just thought it was great and very easy to apply.Gives my skin a natural look."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Neec","Chicago, IL",4,"This product is close to Bare Minerals with a lower price.  I had a coupon which knocked a few dollars off so thought I'd replish my original buy. It has a cool feeling when applying.  Nice!  The coverage is light but enough and doesn't feel heavy.  I don't use the brush on top as it seems too small and texture of nylon. Rather, I use a big brush made of natural fibers.  It's a good size and easy to see when you're running low. It's also easy to match your skin tone."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","MOMOF3","New Braunfels, Texas",5,"I love how it feels and how easily it goes on! <br />I've had to learn to close my eyes because it tends to dry them out if it gets in them."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Alley","Portland, OR",4,"Feels cool on my face when I apply it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Always Outdoors","Arlington, Tx",2,"Marketed as &quot;aqua&quot; makeup. I misinterpreted that to mean stays on in water. Instead, it feels like small bursts of cool water on you face as you apply it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Sandy the Decorator","Troy, Michigan",5,"I just love the way it feels when you apply it!  It has a cool sensation to it and goes on really smooth and light not at all heavy!  I really do not have a complaint about it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Sandy Sun","Montgomery, AL",4,"It was interesting.  The feel was very wet.  It doesn't cover as well as Bare Minerals."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Anna Nymph","Denver, Colorado",5,"I have extremely fair skin and even the lightest shades of foundation are often too dark for me. But the lightest of this is absolutely perfect! And it covers up the red spots and old acne scars perfectly. I bought this just yesterday and I know I want to stock up. <br />It has a different feel going on than any other foundation I've tried because of the cooling sensation but once you get used to it it's a very nice refreshing sensation. Love it!! I defiantly recommend trying it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Maddie","SLC, Utah",4,"This product is amazing! My face feels and looks like there isn't any makeup on, but it still looks flawless. It's just like bareminerals!! Although the cooling effect will catch you off guard the first time you use it, you'll keep coming back to it! The only down side to this make-up is the brush, it takes awhile to apply! My advice: Use a bronzer on top to set the minerals in place"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","henny","Michigan",5,"Unbleieveable refreshing feeling on skin , upon application."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Makeup Chick","Pittsburgh, PA",2,"The dry to wet is very cool. But it lacks in coverage. I have a few blemishes and redness around my nose and it doesn't cover it very well. This stuff is very light. I'll prob use this in the summer."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","ceegee58","Jackson, MS",1,"Maybe I just didn't realize that this mineral powder make-up is WET!!  It didn't cover well at all, and it was hard to apply.  I hated this make-up, it was a total waste of my money.  Thank goodness it wasn't expensive."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Ultimate ULTA fanatic","Plano, TX",4,"This mineral makeup feels wet when it touches your skin. I recommend using a foundation brush for application and blending."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","hannah","atlanta, georgia",2,"I'm very fair and was surprised the color was a good match.  The product goes on well, feels good, and gives light to moderate coverage.  Once outside, both my teenaged daughters asked if I had put glitter on my face.  We went and brought the product outside and tested on hands and their faces.  It sparkles!  Not a light shimmer or a luminesent look, but sparkles like a fine glitter.  Not a good look for a mature mom of three.   Neither of my daughters would consider wearing this daily.   It is now in th theatre/stage make-up box.  I wish the company would make a more matte version,  liked the color and feel."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Bee","Dallas, TX",5,"I have sensitive skin and my face tends to break out with a lot of the foundation make ups, but not with this one.  It feels like it is nourishing my skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","PC","Wauwatosa, WI",2,"I am really disappointed in this product and even more diappointed that I can no longer get the original Color Stay mineral foundation. This product goes on feeling wet, so it is heavier and doesn't feel natural. Also, because it goes on wet it seems to soak into my pores and make them look larger instead of gliding over them. It also sets into the few minor wrinkles under my eyes and makes them look deeper. I will be looking to other product lines for a better mineral foundation now, which is sad because I soooo LOVED the original version in this line."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Drey","Texas",4,"Every bit as good as bare minerals at half the price.  The application brush is pretty useless though, I use my kabuki brush for best application."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Heather","Franklin, Indiana",5,"I love the feeling of this powder going on. It has a wonderful cooling sensation and feels damp when you apply it but isn't. It has a light coverage but goes beautifully over other foundations for a complete, full coverage if that's what you re looking for. Wayne Goss (YouTube makeup artist) suggested putting your moisturizer on, then primer, then powder (yes BEFORE foundation), and then your foundation for all day hold and this actually works perfectly for that use and stays on ALL day. Never need to touch up even after 16 hours. This is a wonderful powder and I actually purchased several bottles just in case I can't find it again. Never can have too much of a good thing!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","TCMeacham","Denver, CO",1,"HATE THIS! It feels wet when you put it on, and as soon as it is applied to your skin it darkens considerably! I have used regular mineral foundation in the past and it has been wonderful. I saw that this one advertises for moisturizing, which I thought I would try since I have dry skin. Total waste of money. NO coverage, just looks like I rubbed carrot juice all over my face."

I liked the small shimmer. The thing that really irritates me is that I have a great mineral brush and I make sure my face is nicely hydrated and still the make up looks dry and just blah. I am 21 with moderate acne. The coverage is poor and goes away quickly. Not worth the money and hopefully I will find a better product."

I don't think the brush really distributes enough or any product on my face. Get rid of the fancy packaging, let ME get to the product and use a puff."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","Chubby Rat","Seattle, WA",5,"For my sensitive, aging, dry skin, this is the best foundation I've ever used. It gives moderate coverage that stays on and, if you get the right color, is nearly undetectable. My job requires me to be outdoors in the cold and this product works beautifully to cover up the shiny red 'outdoor nose'. As far as application goes, I found it very easy to apply, even with the tiny attached brush, but I have used mineral makeup exclusively for well over 10 years and can apply it in my sleep. The only criticism I've got is the limited color range. Hopefully the line will catch on and they can add a few more colors for us oddly colored girls. Otherwise, great product."

I had the Bare Minerals mineral powder and it just seemed too shiny for my skin type. This mineral powder is very nice. I'm not sure about the color--I always have trouble matching my very fair skin with reddish undertones--but I think I may buy another bottle that is one shade lighter and mix the two. It goes on with a very &quot;cool&quot; sensation and it lasts all day. I use a big powder brush to apply it, as the brush that comes with it is just too small."

So if you want to cover acne you'll have to use a separate concealer. But it looks natural and its great for acne prone skin. My face actually looks healthier and has less breakouts now that I've started using this product. My skin is dry on some spots so it's nice that this foundation keeps my face moisturized. But it does not get cakey or make your skin feel healthy/thick/oily at the end of the day, which IS THE BEST. The only thing, is that its pricey."

The color I found it perfect for my skin tone - not too orange or too beige like so many foundations are. I can wear it light or put it on heavy. It still looks good. Now that contouring is a big thing I contour and then put this all over my face to blend everything together for a nice smooth natural look. <br /><br />I don't use the silly little brush that comes with it...

So I end up wearing it after I wash my face without sunscreen or moisturizer.  If Revlon would add a good amount of SPF to this mineral powder it will be worth repurchasing.

I was also pleased that the fair tint of this product actually matched my skintone - I'm very fair and it's difficult to find a match for my complexion.  <br />However, it becomes damp and difficult to apply. I noticed that it sank into fine lines and pores which was unflattering. At the end of the day, the make-up caused my face to become COMPLETELY DRY. I had blotchy dry patches that turned red and started to peel. I stopped using the make-up and applied heavy lotion to the affected areas and luckily my face cleared up within two to three days. I put a swatch of the make-up on my hand for a couple of days to test it, and the same thing happened. I have no allergies and have used a variety of make-up brands and this is the first time any allergic reaction has occurred. I would never recommend this product to anyone."

I've found using a liquid concealer can cover it up, but then I always have a shine and it looks unnatural. I know people typically use liquid or powder, but I like to apply liquid and use powder to soften it up and smooth it out.The Physicians Formula is probably the best I've found, but they don't come in a light enough color for when I haven't been in the sun. And I refuse to pay $30+ for the Laura Mercier loose minerals. So this is where ColorStay comes into play.I love that it is a loose powder and comes in various shades. The price isn't bad at [$]. I think it will last me at least a couple months. I even enjoy the cooling sensation when I apply it. I just wish it had a better brush for applying.

I don't like Bare Minerals in general because the coverage is poor, it makes my skin itch, and I feel I look OLDER when I use it. Bare Minerals Mineral Veil does NOT look good over liquid foundation.  I love this Revlon product because the coverage is easily adjustable--just use another bigger brush (I use Sonia Kashuk's fluffy blush brush) and I can wear it alone or over my liquid foundation and the finish is impeccable.  Don't use the little brush except for touch ups or you may not have the same result. As with any product, you need the right tools for the right end result. I am stocking up on this one!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-aqua-mineral-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2910097","The Pale Goddess","Tulsa, OK",4,"Provides lightweight coverage which can be layered for a heavier look. It is perfect for wearing as a finishing powder over a foundation if you are seeking a fuller coverage, without looking cakey. Personally I like the subtle &quot;glow&quot; though if you wear it with glitter or other metallic makeup etc. it could be too much. <br /><br />Comes in a large range of shades and finally a &quot;fair&quot; that is actually not too dark for my porcelain skin.<br /><br />I wear it everyday over a primer (though it goes on smoothly in-and-of-itself)and have never had a problem with breakouts, lasts even in high humidity and I never have to touch it up. I recommend investing in a higher quality brush than the one included which will help it's application. As to the &quot;wet&quot; feeling, I find it refreshing and though I was skeptical at first as to how well it would stay and whether or not it would slid off my face I was pleased. After you apply it a couple of times you don't notice the feeling anymore so it is really personal preference. <br /><br />Overall, for the money, it is a good product for those seeking a natural mineral foundation and makes your skin look healthy and radiant."

I would describe it as a unique hydrating setting powder. <br /><br /> I have dry skin. I like this since it is hydrating for a powder.. where some powders can cling to my dry areas and look flaky like theres, well, powder all over my face, this one does not. It works well to set my revlon whipped cream foundation (which i am in love with.) It doesn't make me look dry and flaky, and leaves a nice natural finish. <br /><br />It comes with a little paddle style retractable brush cleverly designed so it fits into the lid. It's a nice quality brush, but it likes to retract really easily and is a little small for practical use.. I feel like it is very convenient if you want to put it in your purse or travel with it. I like to use a similar shaped brush thats bigger to put it on.<br /><br />Theres the initial cool feeling when you apply this- it's pleasant I suppose but it is only when you first apply it and doesn't really affect the overall performance of the product. <br /><br />This has a little sparkle to it. (I just think it's weird;) if given a choice, I would always go without sparkle. I would give it a perfect rating if it did not have the sparkle!  Thankfully it is very subtle so I still like it overall."

It's hard to find this kind of sun protection in makeup products (I have medium skin that I'm trying to protect due to melasma/hyperpigmentation). Although I also wear sunblock underneath, I feel better that I'm protecting my skin. Instead of the little brush, I've found using my fuller, natural fiber brush worked better for an even application. The wet feeling is weird at first, but now I think it's refreshing. Coverage is great - evens out my skin tone, works well over concealer and blends with mineral bronzer or blush.  A bit of finishing powder downplays the shimmer during the day; and in the evening, I have a healthy glow."

Some people say it feels refreshing, but to me, frankly, it feels strange. The worst part of this product, aside from the fact it does a terrible job of covering anything and easily comes off, is that it's sparkly. I really don't want to look like a vampire when the sun is hitting my face. Because I impulsively bought this without reading any reviews, I will use it until it's gone.

Packaging makes is difficult to get product onto your brush and tap off excess without making a mess. Why are mineral foundation pots always tall/narrow? Why can't they make wide/flat pots so we can tap off excess without making a mess...<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was my very first Revlon cosmetic purchase ever (always been a cover GURL and then Urban Decay/Mac/BobbiBrown GURL) and I think I'm going to &quot;Stick to what I know.&quot; <br /><br />Thanks! :) ~Danni"

It can last for about 8 hours without the primer, but requires a touch up if you don't. This doesn't have a whole lot of coverage so it won't be good for those who need it. I wanted something that was very light and natural looking and this was perfect for me. The product also has a lot of the light-reflecting minerals in it, which is the result of the &quot;youthful, luminous finish&quot; it is known for. As many other reviews have shown, a GOOD BRUSH is required for this product... the brush it comes with won't do anything for you. I love it however, for applying my under eye and blemish concealer.
