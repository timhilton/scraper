I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.  I received this product in shade 705, HD Shine, to review.  I was very excited to try this lip product because the color really appealed to me, and because it was described as being metallic.  I thought the color would be bold, but still natural enough for me to wear on an everyday basis, and I was correct about both of these guesses.  The color is a bit hard to describe, but I would say it's mauve with a slight brownish look, at least on my lips and with my skin tone.  I like the fact that it makes me look polished without looking too made up.  I wish there was a bit more of a metallic look to it, but it's definitely more metallic than a regular matte lip color would be.  I love how evenly and smoothly this product goes on, as well as the fact that the color is very long-lasting.  At the end of the day, I had to wipe my lips several times to remove it before bed.  I would recommend this product if you are looking for a bold, long-lasting lip product for everyday wear."

Mainly because I had assumed they came in really bright colors not suitable for anytime. The Revlon Ultra HD Matte Metallic in Glow gives me the option of going for a bold look without leaving my comfort zone. The packaging looks very sophisticated. The applicator wand is a nice size, flat, with rounded corners and the top. Makes it easy to apply to my lip corners and cupid's arrow. Like another similar product, I found it easier to apply using soft strokes. To avoid streaking on my top lip I put enough product than apply it in downward motion and on my bottom in an upward motion. Its glossy but not really that tacky. I prefer to use it on special outings like dates. To me it smells like hazelnut. I suggest exfoliating lips or end up with crusty looking lips!

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-metallic-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod16171133","FruityLane","Lapeer, Michigan",4,"I have the shade Glow.  I find that the pigmentation is a bit lacking with this shade.  I applied two coats and my natural lip color is still peaking through a tiny bit.  I think this is more suited to be a lip topper more than a stand alone liquid lipstick.  That could just be my tendency to stick to more classic lip styles, though.  It would work so well with their other liquid lipstick, in my opinion.  The smell reminds me of vanilla or strawberry icing, but that does not last long on the lips.  It feels smooth and silky on my lips, but does dry down to a matte finish after awhile!  This does transfer!  The color will stick to the lips, however.  It really is a pretty, dynamic color!  It's something that really catches your eye. My lips do not try out and feel pretty moisturized.  I think it's great compared to most other metallics, but only decent for matte &quot;transfer-proof&quot; lipsticks in general.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-metallic-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod16171133","Marshall","Dallas, TX",4,"I've purchased Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolors in the past, and I've found them to be pretty hit or miss - the lighter, more neutral tones tend to be pretty good, but the darker tones I've tried have all left me seriously wanting. So, when I received the Ultra HD Matte Metallic lipcolor in Gleam, I already expected that it would become a new favorite. This neutral, warm, pink tone is exactly the type of lip color I would pick up in store, and is exactly the kind that Revlon gets right. It's that perfect &quot;my lips but better&quot; shade, but with the added benefit of SO MUCH GLITTER AND SHINE. <br /><br />The formula has a somewhat whipped consistency, like the rest of the Revlon Ultra HD Matte lip colors, and has that distinct, sweet, candy-like scent. I know some people who aren't a fan of that scent, but I've always liked it. The product applied smoothly, with no streakiness or patchiness. It is a fairly sheer color - I still think it looks really nice alone, but I could see myself using it as a &quot;topper&quot; for other lipsticks, to add a little dimension.<br /><br />I have to say, I do not consider this product - or at least this shade -  to be &quot;metallic&quot;. It's very, very glittery and shiny, but that does not equal metallic. Is it pretty? Yes, very! Is it shiny? Yes, very! Am I going to recommend it to others? Yes, totally! But is it metallic? No. No it is not.<br /><br />Now, for anyone who had never used a Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor before, ARE NOT completely transfer proof and DO NOT dry down completely. Although, I think that's why I like them so much - because of this, they aren't drying, like so many other matte lip products. And I can live with a little bit of transfer as long as it keeps my lips from feeling like the Sahara desert. <br /><br />*This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

When I got the chance to try out this product I found that I really liked the formula and that it wasn't a drying formula like most liquid lipsticks. The product did not clump up and it provided an even application. I did not have to pair it with a lip liner because the product was opaque enough that my natural lip color did not show through. The formula was long-lasting and nourishing as well. I would buy this product again and will be trying other shades.  The metallic was very faint but could be noticed in natural lighting."

I love anything with a Metallic tint, and I quite liked the shine this product leaves on the lips.  I feel as though this product is perfect for layering on top of your favorite nude lipstick or lip balm.  Also, I really loved the aesthetically appealing bottling, and the look and/or feel of it - since it recalls products of high quality.  As for color, anyone unsure which of these in the series to try, I would recommend starting with this color since it is perfectly suitable for any occasion, and will not clash with the rest of your makeup.  This Metallic Matte Lipcolor is perfect for any daily beauty regimen.  Unlike it's counterpart the Matte this is more easy to glide across your lips, and a quick pucker will fix any spots you may have missed if you are in a rush.  Hence, I would like to rate this product five out of five stars.  I would definitely purchase this product (probably in this color), and would definitely recommend this to any of my family and/or friends.

It's not as metallic as I thought it would be, but I initially tried Gleam for that reason - keep it slightly neutral  before jumping into the metallic. It's more of a subtly metallic gleam, IMO. Hopefully them come out with come more colors, especially in the darker/bold colors (like red).

I have experimented with both higher end and lower end options, but have settled in with cheaper alternatives like Colourpop. This Revlon &quot;HD Glam&quot; metallic was an impulse buy in the store, but I have actually found myself loving it. I would not necessarily call it long lasting, especially if you are eating, kissing, drinking, etc. However, if you're just at work or out and not putting your lips into much action, this lipstick will stay in place. The color payoff is great! If you're like me and have dry lips/skin, I would recommend applying a lip balm of some sort, drying your lips, and then applying this lipstick. The packaging is in a convenient shape and the wand is actually wonderful. It is flat on both sides and has proven very helpful in application. Overall, I really like the color, but I hesitate giving it five stars because of the lasting capabilities."

I wanted to, believe me: I love the idea of liquid lipsticks and metallic lips is a huge trend right now! Unfortunately, HD Shine turned my lips a strange combination of brown and shiny copper. The applicator was not precise at all, so that when I tried to put a second layer of the product on, the color went on uneven and made my lips sticky. On the bright side, it has a very pleasant smell. Maybe this product would be better in a different color or on a different skin tone (I am very fair and cool-toned).<br /><br />&quot;This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I really liked the color its a light pink shade so not to light and not bold. Great for a natural look to your make up. It is in a liquid form with an easy to use applicator that applies the lip color evenly, no clumping. When it goes on it sets quickly leaving a velvety, moisturized feel on your lips. Upon first use I wasn't getting the &quot;metallic&quot; name until I put it on then I saw the shimmer which at first I was afraid I wasn't going to like being one who doesn't like any of her makeup to stand out, but it sets and isn't as noticeable as originally though. Great product which I would use on a daily basis to give that little hint of color to my lips. *this review was sponsored by crowdtap and revlon through a sampling activation.

I think that since the market is so oversaturated in amazing metallic liquid lipsticks now though, that to really stand out as great, a formula has to be spectacular, and this simply didn't blow me away.  It's alright, but it's not long-wearing and it doesn't ever dry down all the way.  If I were in a pinch in a drug store, I would probably reach for one of these.  If I had 2 weeks and 35 bucks, I'd just go and buy all the AOA wonder metals and most of their liquid lipsticks, too since the quality of those is much higher and for a much lower price."

The shape of the container is eye catching.  It goes on super smooth and even.  I love the shine.  I'm not sure i understand the Metallic Matte name --that seems like a dichotomy to me.  It doesn't seem like a matte finish.  It is definitely metallic/glossy.  The color from outside the bottle was a little misconceiving.  It looks almost like a mauve or on the dark pink shade.  When you actually put it on-- its actually more like a medium brown shade.  But oh so pretty and complimentary to my skin tone.  I tend to go for the more glossy looks so this has become quickly one of my favorite go to's for every day use. This item does come off on cups when I drink water pretty easily but that wasn't a problem for me, I just reapply! Highly recommend."

The color HD Glow describes it perfectly in that it's a bold, richly-pigmented color that truly stands out with a matte finish and added bonus....it smells absolutely yummy with notes of mango and vanilla!! In the past, my experience with matte formulas has mostly been that they're drying and spotty, but this formula is a great improvement leaving you with lips that really stand out with serious staying power!!

I have always been more prone to glosses don't normally prefer metallics but this one is an excellent choice.  It is lightweight and feels great. The only downfall I can see is that it fades off quicker than I would like but that is always to be expected when using a gloss.

It's not super long-lasting, but it's definitely worth re-applying! It's a super affordable option to stay on-trend with metallic lip colors!

The formula doesn't dry my lips out like a lot of similar products do and I really like the shape of the applicator and the nice packaging.  This liquid lipcolor is something between a liquid lipstick and a lip gloss; it delivers pigment but it doesn't dry down very quickly and I found that it does transfer somewhat while waiting for it to finally set (which seems to take about a half hour or so for me).  That being said, it feels pretty comfortable and has a pleasant taste as well so I really don't mind having to reapply it as necessary.  Although this is marketed as being &quot;metallic&quot;, that isn't how I would describe its appearance although I would say that it looks just slightly glossy.  Hopefully Revlon will develop a broader range of shades in the future because I would like to buy this again in the future but would like more color options.  <br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I also like that when it wears off, my lips look natural -- not stained to some weird color or worn off in the middle but still present on the lip line like so many other lip glosses.

At first it goes on kind of glossy and shiny and I was worried it wouldn't have a matte finish like it is suppose to. But after it sets, it does have a matte finish so I was happy. It feels really silky when it goes on and it doesn't dry my lips out. Actually my lips feel pretty hydrated. I think it has a long wear. I didn't reapply for at least 4 hours. The color goes on really evenly as well. I didn't have to keep coating it on to get an even color like some of the darker shades. It looks great and feels great.

This has a very pleasantly light scent that's a bit vanilla and a bit tropical. It's very easy to apply and to blend. It transfers a little bit at first but once that top layer is off it will stay put. I wore this from 10:30am to 10:30pm!!! Even after I shower it still stayed on (I forgot about it). The metallic finish can definitely exaggerate any fine lines on the lips but it's a cool look. It wears very comfortably and also fades slowly and very nicely.

As for matte they seem to look like they dry matte however its so creamy that if you eat, drink or use a paper towel it will wipe right off, I even had it come off with just my finger after a few hours. So for me this isn't a true matte lipcolor since I'm used to the ones that actually dry all the way and can last for long periods of time without reapplying. With all that said as for color &quot;Shine&quot; is not a bad color, i would like to say its a mauve like rouge color, its slightly dark but still light enough to be an everyday color. It's for the days you want to be more bold but still feel like you have a natural look.

At first when I put it on it's not matte and it transfers but if you take the minutes and let it dry completely this is amazing!!

Shade 716 HD Glow looks very pretty on my lips and provides long wearing coverage.  It provides a bit of shimmer unlike other matte products since it's a metallic shade. It did stain my skin and I had to use quite a bit of baby wipes to remove it at the end of the day. So for this reason I give it 4 stars. It works a bit too well for staying power. I still recommend it if you are looking for a matte lip product that doesn't dry out your lips. This is it.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

Its a matte color, so it looks more natural and less shiny.  The shape of the brush makes it easy to apply.  However like most lip colors its doesn't hold up well to eating and drinking.

I won't be buying again. There's pretty much no colour even after 3 coats and it's shimmery rather than metallic. It wears off easily and the shimmer particles end up all around my mouth."

It came in a nice tube with convenient applicator. It smells better than I expected too. When I saw the name, I thought the color would be a bit more intense.<br />It went on smoothly and didn't irritate my lips. The color shows up as expected on my lips. The color doesn't last on your lips for very long though.<br />My biggest issue with the product is that it is not cruelty free.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-metallic-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod16171133","kylieq3","Providence, RI",3,"I have the shade Glow.  I find that the pigmentation is a bit lacking with this shade.  I applied two coats and my natural lip color is still peaking through a tiny bit.  I think this is more suited to be a lip topper more than a stand alone liquid lipstick.  That could just be my tendency to stick to more classic lip styles, though.  It would work so well with their other liquid lipstick, in my opinion.  The smell reminds me of vanilla or strawberry icing, but that does not last long on the lips.  It feels smooth and silky on my lips, but does dry down to a matte finish after awhile!  This does transfer!  The color will stick to the lips, however.  It really is a pretty, dynamic color!  It's something that really catches your eye. My lips do not try out and feel pretty moisturized.  I think it's great compared to most other metallics, but only decent for matte &quot;transfer-proof&quot; lipsticks in general.

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-matte-metallic-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod16171133","talijane","GA",4,"This goes on with a ice amount of thickness, is pleasantly scented, and is only a tiny bit hard to get even since it is such a dark color.  I really like how it feels on my lips and actually stays put much better than normal tube lipsticks. It doesn't make my lips feel dry and cracked like some other lip products do.  Just know that the dark colors are very pigmented and if you don't look good in dark lipsticks, this will also not look great on you lol (I was sent a dark color and oh man the pigment is amazing, but the dark color makes me look sick.)

The Metallic factor turned out to be be a fine glitter and the lipstick was not matte at all. The formula is instead a gloss that's sticky and never dries, slides off easily and is pretty much the gloss that a teenager would wear.  The color is pretty and the balm smells terrific but this is in no way what I consider to be a matte or metallic finish.<br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I was really looking to Revlon Metallic Matte, because the idea of an opaque and metallic lip looks gorgeous. However, this product isn't opaque, which is a turn off, so please increase the opaque factor. Second, just call them Revlon Metallic, because they are not Matte in any way. I love Revlon and they make good products, but this product is badly executed. Third, I am not sold on the color HD Shine because of the bad execution."
