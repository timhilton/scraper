"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Liz","Tennessee",3,"This mascara is pretty average for a drugstore brand. Its ok, but not great. It does lengthen like it says but does nothing to add volume. The color is good and provides nice even coat to lashes. This formula seems to be very wet compared to most other mascaras I've used making it easy to transfer color from your lashes to the skin around your eyes. Overall, it gets the job done but there are better products out there."

"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","On the go kind of gal","Chicago, IL",3,"Overall, this is a good mascara in alower price range.  I use -It, Super Hero- and was hoping for a &quot;to go&quot; product. Unfortunately, as with most, you MUST use a primer or this product flakes off. The mascara delivers good coverage and removes easily."

"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Slick","Las Vegas",1,"Total waste of money.  No wonder it was 50% off."
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Oakleyg","El Paso, TX",1,"I would never recommend this mascara. It clumps your lashes together, instead of adding volume it made it look like I had fewer lashes. It is hard to remove, and crumbles off rather than just wipe off when removing. Total waste of money."
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Honeybzzy","Chicago",5,"THE BEST 'TUBES' MASCARA BAR NONE. I have used more expensive 'tube' mascaras -Mega Multiplier is the BEST!! It goes on like a dream and gives my sparse lashes length &amp; volume. Long lasting and I'm an OILY lid gal. I also wear concealer. No smudging ever. Good for sensitive eyes. Washes away with warm water &amp; slight downward pressure to the lash line. When you do so, you will see slender black pieces upon your cheek. Those are the tubes NOT your lashes."
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Lanie","Birmingham AL",3,"I purchased this mascara at another retailer, and immediately got to applying it. It's decent, I guess, but something about the brush shape makes it apply a little unevenly, and it's gloopy, especially on the tip of the brush. I find it easier to apply when I wipe the brush with a napkin before I use it. Doesn't really thicken a whole lot but I will say that it does lengthen decently."
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Nikki","Metairie, LA",3,"I use tubing mascaras because most mascaras, even waterproof formulas, smudge on me, so the fact that this mascara doesn't smudge or run is a huge plus.. The problem with this mascara is it doesn't give much volume and it makes my just curled lashes stick straight immediately after applying."

"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","elilbitz","East coast",4,"I love tube style mascara. If been using No 7 Boots, as in Boots of London, by purchasing online for several years. This seemed like a good alternative. It's not quite as good, as the brush, to me is way too long and cumbersome, and more strokes are needed to get same effect. I've always used a pin to separate lashed, no matter what formula I've used, so using it here was no big deal. Once on, it stays on. Lashes feel soft, look great.  Easy removal with warm water. Just splash face/eyes a bunch, then gently tug tubes down and off. It's very easy and gentle."

"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Noelle","Texas",2,"This mascara is okay. I wanted something that would give me a dramatic look with more volume and length. However, it only gave me a natural look with length. The coats were very thin. I had to apply three - four coats."
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Brit","Mooresville nc",5,"Actually like this mascara, it goes on smooth and I love how my lashes look."
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","Nixie","Upstate NY",4,"I have been using this mascara for a few days and I am pretty impressed. It stays on very well and I have a problem with most mascaras (even waterproof ones) staying on.  I use another brand's tubing mascara but that is getting hard to find so I tried this as an alternative. It seems to work just as well as the $26 other one at about a third of the price.  My only issue is that it doesn't show up quite as well but I realized I bought the brown/black version instead of the black one so it may be the color. It is very nice for a more casual or daytime look though. Just not as dramatic as I like for dressier occasions. (Black mascara is about as dramatic as I get for makeup.). I will definitely be trying the black color and alternating this with my other favorite mascara (Benefit's They're Real )."

"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","none","New Jersey",4,"like the color mix"
"http://www.ulta.com/mega-multiplier-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod16171131","S. Bee","Los Angeles, CA",4,"This is a great mascara. Almost as good, in fact, as the new L'Oreal Voluminous Lash Paradise mascara. I would say this mascara even has a better brush; L'Oreal's formula is just slightly better at separating and volumizing the lashes. Definitely worth your pennies though."
