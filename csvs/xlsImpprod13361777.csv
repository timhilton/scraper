"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","ANITA","NEW YORK",3,"I really wanted to love this mascara. I saw the other good reviews &amp; figured I'll try it. The brush itself is nice as far as separating but, that's all it does. It doesn't give me length or volume (even after I apply a few coates) I have cheaper mascara's that work much better."

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","HP","Montana",5,"I love finding a new drugstore mascara to love. This one lengthens and defines, the formula doesn't flake on me and dries quickly. And it's buildable! I can't wait to buy a few more from this new line."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Momo","Watertown, SD",5,"I've been using this mascara for almost a week and I love it! I love how it separates my lashes way better than other mascaras I've used. It's great with or without lash primer and I haven't noticed any clumpy. Plus, I love how Revlon simplified their mascaras by only having 5 of them, which makes buying a mascara more stress free!"

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Ginger","Hebron, MD",5,"It goes on with just applying one coat. It never smudges."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","J","GA",5,"This is my favorite mascara right now, it is great in a number of ways. First of all, the formula avoids my two dealbreakers of either flaking or being sticky and hard to remove, but still manages to have a good staying power, never smudging. It also still manages to come off easily with face wash and water alone without pulling any lashes out scrubbing it off. The was is kind of magical, it really grabs each lash meaning you can get a good curl by just pulling up slowly as you put it on. It also just does no clump and does a pretty amazing job lengthening. It is versatile in that 1 or 2 coats leaves you looking very natural if you use a light hand, but you can build on 4 or 5 to get some pretty intense volume without any clumping! For those who are having problems with volume or length, I would try changing you technique. I like to start by slowly moving up the lash, wiggling slightly at the base, to give a good curl and initial separation and then build on subsequent coats first dragging the brush slightly towards one side (left or right) and then repeating dragging the other way. That really helps with the volume building while stopping clumping. Last, I like to lightly go over the tips of my lashes to get maximum length and hit the outer corners. The curling helps open up your eyes so much (I don't even use my lash curler any more), and when you play up the volume with multiple coats you can get a pretty intense eye look with mascara alone. Does not irritate my slightly sensitive, contact-wearing eyes."

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","ulta lover","Virginia",4,"This is a decent mascara-- not the best but not the worst. I will say it's better than the All-In-one. I was very disappointed in that one. This lengthens better. I'll try the lengthening one next."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Eve69","Seattle",5,"I purchased several mascaras after removing lash extensions.  This mascara was the winner by far, lashes are thick, long and defined....lashes look almost as good as the extensions!"
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","SP","Redwood City",5,"I used to use the Revlon Lash Potion Grow and was sad to see it removed from the shelves. I've tried several of the new formulas and this one works best for me. It works really well and doesn't flake or irritate my eyes. My lashes look long and defined."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Betsy","Frederick, MD",3,"I like the small wand. It keeps things clean. But it does make my my lashes look rather leggy and thin."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Lilyann","Seguin , tx",4,"I simply love this mascara for everyday use ."

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Bekah","NY",5,"I am going to buy another one tomorrow actually. I wore this and I was asked multiple times if I was wearing fake eyelashes, I mean I have pretty decent eyelashes but it's like falsies in a bottle. I have owned the &quot;Better than sex&quot; mascara which had pretty close affects to this yet it was very flaky. I personally believe it gives more length and volume and it only starts to flake when you hit the three month mark but technically you're only supposed to have it for one month so I'd say it's pretty darn great"

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Oooo","Rock Hill, SC",5,"I applied at least 4 coats &amp; that's pretty much it....of course you have to left and among other things while doing it like any other mascara."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","DW","Princeton mn",3,"Ok but had hoped the hype with the new brush would really be a great product"
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","J","Knoxville, TN",4,"Use this every time I make-up my face!  Like the flexible brush."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Cass","WA",5,"Plain and simple: gets the job done, doesn't irritate my eyes, and isn't super hard to remove it with the soap that I use. That's all I ask."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Liz","Kalamazoo, MI",1,"I was looking for mascara to create definition. This mascara also claims to work great for sensitive eyes. It does not. the brush is horrible and the mascara runs and smudges as soon as you out it on. Very itchy and uncomfortable for sensitive eyes. I was looking forward to using this but it looks like it's going in the trash."

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Happycamper","Tyler, TX",4,"Very pleased. This isn't heavy, really defines well and doesn't glob together. You can apply multiple layers for thicker lashes or go simple ms clean."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Kye","Michigan",5,"I prefer my mascara to darken and define my lashes, while leaving the length and volume alone.  I also hate clumping, so this mascara is perfect for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","AShley","NY",2,"Okay, average mascara."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","cdot14","Oklahoma",5,"I want color, separation, curl and length. That's it. I don't need thick, tarantula looking eyes. Definitely no clumps. This mascara does just that. Oh, and I just recently got LASIK and my eyes are super dry so I put eyedrops in hourly. This mascara doesn't smudge and run. It's a winner if you are looking for separation and no clumps. I can't comment on how quickly it dries eye since I've only has for a week."

"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Katie","Minnesota",4,"Works well"
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Batol Alyunisi","Dearborn mi",3,"Love what it does to my lashes keeps them so lengthy but I hated how it doesn't dry quickly and it smears on my upper and lower part of  eyes"
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Mel","Spokane, WA",3,"It is okay but I think there are better drugstore mascaras out there. It's just too clumpy and hard to work with, like I said there are cheaper options that do work better."
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Brookie","Orange",4,"I really like this mascara.  I'm used to paying over $25 for mascara,  and this one is just as good of not better.  I have really oily skin,  so any mascara will run a bit on me,  if I'm not using waterproof.  This one stays on my lashes better than much more expensive brands.  Super impressed"
"http://www.ulta.com/dramatic-definition-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361777","Amanda T","Coeur d'Alene, ID",5,"Let me start by saying I have tried EVERY drugstore mascara over the years, including a few high-end mascaras. I have taken issue with every single one. I like mascara to be easily removable but not flaky, and that seems to be a tall order! I immediately tried each mascara of this new Revlon line when they came out. I've liked every single one, but the purple dramatic definition mascara is perfect for my Goldilocks needs! I love that it defines every single lash and gives that trendy thick lash look without being clumpy. It doesn't flake and doesn't end up on my face when I use it on my lower lashes. It comes off easily at night and makes my lashes long and beautiful. I've had several people ask if I was wearing false lashes! Something about the mascara wand is just magical. If it sounds too good to be true, it absolutely should be! I'm so glad I found this product!"
