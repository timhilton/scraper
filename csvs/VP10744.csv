"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Make-Up Mom","Park Forest IL",5,"Eyeliner can tend to smudge and give me racoon eyes. I keep buying this one because it goes on great and stays all day with out smearing on me."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","WI","AZ",5,"I have purchased other brands such as L'oreal and Covergirl, but I have realized this is the only one that goes on smoothly and doesn't smear and fade after a full day!  The tip on this stays smooth and it allows me to use it precisely.  Other eyeliners I have tried either break off so easily and leave a jagged edge, or are so smooth and creamy that they end up smudging above and below my eyelids in a short length of time.  Others that have complained about this eyeliner not lasting must have very oily eyelids.  I put CoverGirl Aquasmooth foundation as an eyelid primer.  I can easily remove this eyeliner with my face cleansing towelettes."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Pat","Pennsylvania",4,"The Revlon black eyeliner goes on smoothly.  Most eyeliners make my eyes burn, but this eyeliner didn't give me any problems.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it didn't stay on as long as I thought it would.  But it is a great product that I would purchase again."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Aunt Lenie","Los Angeles",2,"Purchased as an inner lid liner. Didn't work as it's not dense enough for an easy to apply solid line. Returning the product."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","SM","Robinson, TX",3,"Only used this eyeliner for a few days, but by the end of an 8 hour work day, I had smudges under my eyes and the color has faded.  I really want something that doesn't cost a lot and that will last.  Thought this was it from some of the other reviews I had read."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","cali teen","san jose, CA",2,"This eyeliner is nice and pigmented when i swatch it on my hand. However, on my eyelid, it drags sooo badly and its like its sticking to your eyelid and doesn't want to move, the so line is very uneven and unconsistent. so i decided to try it on my waterline. However, there, it is like its diliuted by the water there because theres almost no pigmentation and you have to go over it many times to get any color payoff."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Shannon","Connecticut",3,"While I think it is creamy and nice, it has the potential to fade/run throughout the day. It also tends to break easily so I would definitely have a back up eyeliner."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Radioactive_red","Houston,TX",2,"The color is not very intense and it wears off from my waterline very quickly. It looks great for about an hour though."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Klinz","FLORIDA",5,"This is by far the best eyeliner I ever used. I'm typically a department store high end shopper. All of my makeup is high end with the exception of the Revlon colorstay eyeliner and the brow powder by wet n wild. I've tried every eyeliner ranging from Tarte, makeup forever, lancome, stilla, Mac, Marc jacobs as well as many others. No matter what the consistency they all get into the corners of my eyes and start smudging throughout the day. Not this one. It glides on and is true to its name staying put all day! I sometimes go over it close to the lash line with the stila liquid liner if I want a more dramatic evening look but mostly this on its own is perfect. My second choice would be the Makeup forever aqua XL but that one still eventually bleeds. Buy it. You won't regret it."

I decided to try this eyeliner expecting the same quality but i was thoroughly disappointed. It irritated my waterline and caused small white bumps the next day after using this. It was gone within few days and as soon as i gave this another try the bumps appeared again. This has never happened before with me, even with the low quality eye pencils I had used throughout highschool."

I do love this eyeliner because I have always had a problem with eyeliners running and I end up having to wipe under my eyes every few hours. This however does not run! I think I might stick with this eyeliner from now on!"

Tried running it on my had to see if after the first couple uses it would apply easier.  No such luck.  What did actually apply came off in clumps. The color said black but actually ended up being gray and the little bit that was applied on my eye wouldn't come off.  So if you are not worried about hurting your eyes than this is a great product as it does not come off easily."

The black brown is the only brown color that shows up on me, and it looks so natural. When i wear this, it looks like my eyes are naturally defined! <br />You do have to reapply it once through out the day, but it definitely lasts longer than most eyeliners! <br />If you have medium/dark skin (I'm indian for reference), this is the PERFECT everyday eyeliner."

I tried to swatch it on my hand right after opening the package, and THE TIP BROKE OFF. I used the sharpener included on the bottom and tried again, and the color payoff is pathetic. I have the black color, and the most that I got was a gray-ish charcoal hue. It takes a lot of effort just to get the full black color, and it does not apply smoothly at all. The Urban Decay eyeliner is so much better, and it is a lot easier to remove as well. Definitely do not recommend this eyeliner."

I was impressed with how well it stayed on during the day without budging.  I do use an eyeshadow primer prior to applying it and I have not tried it while swimming.  I have teared up from laughing while wearing it and it stayed on great.  It blends well. I notice if I use it along the bottom lash line I can end up with &quot;raccoon eyes&quot; if I don't apply the primer or have sweated.  If you want a thin line you may have to sharpen it a bit which didn't work to well for me using the attached sharpener.  It just fell apart.  I have to work a little harder to get it off at night with my make-up remover. Otherwise, I think I'll be staying with this product for a while."

I can wear this eyeliner at the office since it &quot;slides&quot; along my lids easily it's very simple to apply a thin natural line, when swimming or working out I'm not at all concerned of liner smudging or running. NEVER WORRY OF &quot;RACOON EYES&quot;! Also, if you want a dramatic look you can easily transform the thin line day look to a great thick trendy line."

I tend to need to use an eye make up remover to get it to come all the way off, but I don't really have complaints about that. Good bold color, and I love using it to make the cat eye look.

Worth a try because it's a pretty good product and I have purchased this multiple times."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","searching","florida",3,"I used the product and marked above both that it lasts and wears off over time.  The upper eye lid liner stayed on perfectly and was even there the next morning and lasted through a workout session (I forgot to remove it the night before). My water line faded quickly and was barely there after a few hours. Still looking for a liner that will stay on my lower water line to give me that bold look."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Brown eyed girl","Duluth, MN",5,"I have been using this eyeliner for years now and refuse to change. It's a very soft pencil so it applies very smoothly and easily with a single stroke; which means it's not sharp on the sensitive lower lids. When sharpened, it creates very fine lines and a duller tip is great for doing my upper lid. Since it's so soft, it's easy to blend or fix mistakes, but, it will fade and smudge late in the day. However, since it's soft, thd smudges are easily fixed with just a finger. I definitely recommend this product for everyone because it's so universal and easily applied."

I can go to sleep in this and it'll still be put in the morning! I will say, however, that it isn't smooth, and it drags my eyelid when I apply it. If you have this as a problem as well, I'd suggest applying a good primer before hand. Also notice that I said that it is both easy and difficult to remove. The liner does not come off well solely with water! What you can do, though, is put a small amount of olive oil onto a towel, or pad and use the olive oil to remove it. It works like a charm! Makeup remover will probably work as well, but I wouldn't know as I do not use it. But anyway, great eyeliner! Definitely worth the buy!"

This eyeliner stays all day and then some. I have used this for years and I hope they never retire this line. I cannot use a liquid - that's for steadier hands than mine. I have much greater control with this pencil. I highly recommend!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","rosieroz","Troy",5,"I have been using this eyeliner for 3+ years. It's super rich in color (I use the black). In fact, wearing other brands is hard for me since I'm so used to the super black color of Revlon, other brands look too light compared to what I'm used to.<br />This eyeliner is easy to apply and is very long lasting. It fits in well with my lifestyle of long days where I don't have time to retouch my makeup.<br />I can hardly think of a single thing wrong with this product. I suppose some people prefer a super smooth pencil, which this pencil is not. However the smoother pencils in my experience smudge very easily.<br />I wear this products about five times a week on my upper lash line. I have used it on my lower lash line before but it was super harsh and I looked like Cleopatra. I stick to eyeshadow drawn eyeliner for the lower lash line."

Within a few ours, you get &quot;raccoon eyes&quot;. Do not waste your money, you can easily find something much better. It has the same quality as something you would purchase at a [@].

For that reason, it doesn't wash off easily. Makeup remover and a q-tip are sometimes needed to get every last trace of it off.

It also barely transfers to my lower waterline but stays exactly where I put it. It easily lasts me a good 6-7 hours without needing touch up. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the black isn't a really deep, dark black - it's more of a faded black."

I mainly bought it because it was cheap (ish), but I fell in love with it for what the eyeliner is itself. It applies nicely and stays on alllllllllllll day. Sure, it doesn't come off easily, but it also says WATERPROOF in the description... So that's probably a good thing if waterproof eyeliner is what you are looking for. It comes off very easily with makeup remover. I use this every day, mostly the brown color, to make my blue eyes pop! I use the sharpener to sharpen the eyeliner when I make the wings. Works pretty well. For the price of this eyeliner, it is AMAZING. Will continue to buy! :)"

It's long-lasting, easy to apply, and doesn't fade or crease throughout the day! I have black/brown and black, and I alternate between the two. The eyeliner glides on so easily, and it doesn't pull on my eyelid when I apply it. The only complaint I have is: the black/brown one keeps breaking when I use it. The black one is fine, but for the black/brown one, I feel like the eyeliner has been mostly wasted. I only have a little bit of the black/brown one left. Also, even though it doesn't fade for the most part, it does run a little bit at the outer corners of my eye, but that happens with all eyeliners because my eyes are a bit watery. Overall, I love this product, and I would buy it again and again."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","beachphantom","northeast, GA",4,"This is a great eyeliner for the price. It does not come off during the day or smear allover the place. If you are looking for a great eyeliner without having to move into a department store cosmetic line, I recommend this one."

It lasts all day without ever needing to be reapplied. <br />It may be difficult to remove, depending on how you wash your face. I use facial cleansing pads and that removes it easily."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Yellow","Toledo, Ohio",3,"When I first opened this eyeliner and applied it I was very pleased.  I was able to make a nice thin line because the tip was sharpened and it glided on easily.  After a few days however, the tip flattened out and it produced a thick fat line that was too heavy.  I tried using the sharpener in the tip but it didn't work.  Sent it back."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Gillian","Va",3,"I got this product today and it is NOT smooth when applying. It's not dry but it acts like it. Maybe I got a bad package but personally I'd not buy it again. and the color isn't a solid dark black I was hoping for. It's like a dark gray."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Dev","Texas",5,"I refuse to use any other eyeliner after I discovered this a few years ago. My face tends to be more oily in the T-zone and I have trouble finding an eyeliner that lasts through lunch time. The ColorStay Eyeliner is the only one I can consistently count on looking good at the end of a work day. <br /><br />Not only does this eyeliner draw on smooth, it also has a removable smudger and a sharpener built in the top part. The sharper allows you to keep a sharp line and I use the smudger to blend in my not so perfect lines when I'm applying in a hurry. <br /><br />Overall this is a great product and I believe it is worth every dollar. It's much more affordable than department store eyeliners (if you can even find a comparable product) and I know it works for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Judy Blue","New Jersey",4,"I have been using this product and returned to it after trying other brands.  It works for me, but I am not totally satisfied.  I may be expecting too much of a pencil liner. I have tried a liquid liner that was very disappointing, so I returned to my tried and mostly true.  I notice that it tends to fade out during the day. If you advertise 16 hours...then it should be close to that at least.<br />I'll keep buying this brand because it has been the best so far."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","RGnSD","San Diego",3,"This is a good, basic liner. Applies easily without tugging. Just wish it lasted longer than a couple of hours."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-eyeliner?productId=VP10744","Polish Princess","Orchard Park, NY",5,"I've used this eyeliner for years - you can't beat it in quality and performance for the price. Some tips - use an oil free primer below eyes and a good lid primer with a dusting of finishing powder for a no-budge line. Let liner set for 60 seconds before finishing with mascara. You will not be disappointed!"

I have used it for years and even though it can run in the corners of my eyes sometimes it's very easy to wipe away. The color is beautiful and bold and glides on easily."

I scurried to ulta wondering around for something cheap yet good. Then finally my eyes met with the plastic covering. I snatched it from the rack from which it was hanging, payed for it then thanked the cashier. I spent my drive home in fear for i was doubtful it would not work. ALAST i got home walked into the bathroom and started to apply the make up. WONDERFUL i said. Tears of joy running down my cheeks meeting each other at the end of my chin.(Long story short, BUY IT you won't be disappointed)"
