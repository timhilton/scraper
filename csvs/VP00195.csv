"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Disappointed","Tenneseee",4,"My biggest frustration with this product is the the cap on the pencil side does not stay on.  After about 10 uses, the cap is shot."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Carol the paddler","Pennsylvania",1,"i thought this would be a great product, but was very disappointed with it.  The pencil is very hard, making it difficult to apply to brows and achieve a natural look.  The gel, once dry, flaked off and looked like I had put glue on my brows."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Sox RN","Houston, TX",3,"The pencil gives good color but I didn't like the brush, it was too thin for me. Nothing special. I have always used MAC brow set and I think I'll pay more for better quality."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Utopia","Marlton, NJ",4,"I would add more color choices to the product line. Limited selection to choose from."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Mel","Cleveland, Ohio",4,"I have tried many eyebrow pencils to match my dark brown color, and found this dark brown which is a perfect match.  The only complaint I have is I end up throwing out a good portion of the pencil because I can't sharpen it due to it not fitting in any pencil sharpeners because it ends up hitting the holder at the end."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Chris, the fiber artist","Rochester Hills, Michigan",5,"This stuff is the only reason my otherwise invisible eyebrows show, and I have brown hair, so it's nice I can do a brow that matches with this, and it looks natural."

I really like the warmth of the brunette shade along with my dark brown hair that has some reddish tones. It's not perfect though. The brow gel is very pigmented but does not hold my thick brows in place like a gel should, and I'm not a big fan of the thickness of the pencil end because It's not very precise"

It is easy to use, and since I am a blonde, I love that it has the blonde color for eyebrows; this prevents it from looking fake!"

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","GraceAbb","Orlando, FL",2,"I loved the first times using this pencil, since I'm a brow fanatic, but part of my brow needs to be filled thanks to an over-excited waxing job. The pencil was easy to use and looked very natural, as I got compliments on how great my brows looked. But when I had to sharpen it, the entire tip fell off, and each time I tried to re-sharpen to remedy this problem, the tip was so soft that it would just completely come off again. Regardless, I kept this tool for the brow gel, which sets your eyebrows pretty well. If the pencil was better quality, then I'd purchase this in bucket amounts."

It's really the best dark brown I've found thus far on the market for my skin tone/hair color. <br />My only complaint would be that the pencil doesn't last quite as long as the provided colored brow gel. I find myself debating whether or not to throw away the previous tube when I buy a new one. I feel like the size of the gel could be decreased with a slight increase in the amount of pencil included."

I love the pencil sice, it's natural and it works really well. It helps hide the gap in one of my eyebrows due to a scar. I like the gel- its easy to apply but it does not last. The pencil color lasts all day, but i find that i have to re-apply the gel to get my brows to stay put. I usually just use a clear brow gel over the pencil."

The pencil is perfect; you don't have to work hard at all to get the light soft lines to draw on.  The gel is not runny, but almost a &quot;dry&quot; gel.  It's perfect!<br /><br />I wear this everyday and don't experience any smudging or anything.  Will definitely repurchase!"

I use Anastasisa but I wanted an all in one thing for my make up bag in my purse and I bought this! If you use anastasica and you want to try this you have to be very careful.

This is a nice 2-in-1 product. I usually run out of the gel long before the pencil. My only complaint is that the dark blonde color is a little too golden for me and I'd prefer a subtle taupe."

It works for every hair color I've had, from bleach blonde to black. It's very versitile and looks natural. I never use the gel because it flakes and I don't need it.

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","72ChevelleGirl","Rohnert Park, CA",4,"This is my first brow pencil/gel and I love it! It's great having both a pencil and gel in one product so you can choose one or both when applying. Both give off a good amount of pigment without being too dark or overwhelming. I gave it only 4 out of 5 stars because the gel tends to dry a little lighter than the dark brown of my brows, but I've learned the less I use, the less noticeable it is. Other than that I think it's a great product at a good price."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","xoxopink","CA",4,"I have medium brown hair and I was looking for a brown eyebrow pencil to fill in my brows. I bought this in light brown and it is a very nice ashy color (good, because I don't want orange eyebrows). I really enjoy the brow pencil end of this product; however, the gel part is flaky and when I apply it, it makes my brows feel and look funky. For the cost, I think its a bit pricey since the pencil part seems to be running out quickly (I use it on a daily basis and it's only been a little over a month). But I do recommend this if you're on the look for an ashy brown colored eyebrow pencil."

Does the trick! Word of advice though, make sure the pencil is sharp at the point, or you won't have a good eyebrow ending line.. it does smear or smudge if you rub it, especially if you have foundation on. I wish it was a longer Pencil, and less setting gel, but it does what it is suppose to other than that. Sometimes the gel leaves a chalky looking residue on your brows, so you have to brush/rub it into your brows in the direction or preference, to make your brows look naturally placed. I have dark-light blonde hair, my brows are an ashy dirty blond.<br /><br />Other than that, it works great, blends well. It's one of my &quot;go to&quot; products, until I find something better to take it's place. :)"

However there are only three color choices- so it not is exactly what I needed to match. The brow gel has to be used in the smallest amount, like almost hardly apply it at all. If you put anymore on,it turns white and looks like glue coming off your eyebrows! The pencil smudges a little, but its not to bad of a issue to deal with. I would use this as a back up eyebrow fix or one for camping for a little fix up. I wouldn't use this on a everyday basis at all."

The pigmentation of the pencil is good but I can't stand the gel. Even when trying to apply it sparsely, it mostly just brushes away all of my work. Unfortunately, the pencil portion is fairly small so I won't get many uses out of the product. My eyebrows are also naturally thin and sparse, so maybe it works better for taming fuller brows."

In other words I want a predict that fills in while also controlling.  This product did that, but best when the gel is about half gone.

The only thing I don't care for is that the pencil doesn't last very long.  I have to keep sharpening it for the best effective use.  I end up purchasing two or more a month!  Refills would be helpful.  Also the lid does't stay on very well causing the pencil to dull as the tip is unprotected."

This product delivers just that.  You can just use the pencil and skip the top coat but it will make the brow application stay longer. Remember less is more use a bit at a time and build.

All of the other ones will smudge off onto my skin and this one has yet to do that. It glides on smoothly and creates a natural looking fill in my brows. I have thin eyebrows that are sandy colored but my hair is dyed dark and this pencil works perfectly to make my brows look full and curvy. I use this product in dark brown. The only thing i wish revlon would do is make this product only in the pencil. I rarely use the gel so Id love it if they came out with just a full size pencil."

It tends to smear and be quite messy. The gel however isn't bad and I'm keeping the product just for the gel. My biggest problem aside from the color is just how difficult it is to use the pencil--the tip is too big so if you have thin eyebrows this is not the pencil for you."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Lyrics121","Ruston, LA",4,"This is good filler for my transparent blonde brows. The gel really sets it in place. Just be sure you use only a little gel and smooth it out, or it will flake or give you clumps. My only issue is that the pencil itself is really short and runs out quickly. Once the pencil gets too small you can no longer sharpen it because of the plastic tip. The gel lasts a little longer and that is good to have around no matter what other pencil I use."

As you can see from the picture, the pencil portion is very small. It applied significantly better when it was sharpened so after only a couple weeks of regular use and sharpening, the pencil had run out. There is still a tiny bit left but it is flat and cannot be sharpened bc of the plastic. It blends well and gives good color, it lasted through the day each time I used it.

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Hannah","Statesville, NC",1,"The gel is amazing. I'd buy it just for the gel &amp; forget the pencil. The pencil just doesn't mark very well on skin. It draws a very thick, slimy-like line vs a sharp, thin line. Smudges really bad. Maybe the pencil is just all around too big but the actual product &amp; the way it applies is just off for some reason."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Belle","Colorado",5,"This product is everything! I have been filling in my eyebrows with a pencil for a long time. Over time I started to get irritated because at the end of the day I'd come home or I'd be out and look in the mirror and see that my eyebrows weren't staying in shape and needed to be brushed. I bought this product not for the color or pencil, I bought it for the serum brush stick that you brush over your eyebrows as a step 2 to keep them in place. I realized after trying this product that it really does hold your eyebrows in place and holds color and style extremely well."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","MIbabe","Michigan",5,"I love this eyebrow pencil- call me crazy, but I love it a lot more than ABH. The color just slightly darkens my original brows and fills them in. I just use this product to fill in the color of my brows- not draw them on or make individual little 'hair like' strokes, where I could see how the other pencil comes in handy. With already having established eyebrows- this is the pencil for me!!!!"

For me, the color match on both the pencil and the tinted brow gel is good. The product is easy to apply and I have found that I run out of both products at about the same time.

The gel is good because it keeps your brows in place while looking natural. BUT, it sometimes is a little bit gloppy but with some combing through it is fine. The reason I took off a star was because the gel smells TERRIBLE. When I was first applying it one morning, I was disgusted with myself because I thought I smelled like nasty B.O but it is actually the gel, luckily it goes away once it dries but it smells bad."

It goes on smoothly and I love the setting gel that glides on after I use the pencil to color my brows. The gel keeps my brows from absorbing into my skin, especially during the humid, hot summer months.

I'm really happy I go this after considering many, many options. the only draw back is realizing how fast I'm going through it. the short pencil isn't going to last that long, I wish they sold it separately and full size to keep at home while I take this with me.

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Ace","MN",5,"The only thing I would say about this is the color looks really light and even though I have dark brown hair with brownish eyebrows, I went with the light because the other was so dark. This is a perfect match and I love that the gel comes with it! already purchased a second and third one!"
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","i.amthebadwolf","Savannah, GA",1,"This Product is HORRRRIBLE. I returned it after the ten minutes it took to get to my car, use it, and walk right back into the store. Nobody wants an eyebrow filling pencil with no pigment to their supposedly 'dark brown' option, and it's shiny!! I'd be embarrassed to wear this in public. Comes out light orange. Ick."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Emma A","Manhattan, IL",1,"I'm pretty tan, and this color just did not show up on me. Saying this is the darkest color available I was kinda bummed. I used it once to go out to dinner, by the time I got home I had a couple pimples on each eyebrow. I'm returning it."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","markas","tampa, fl",4,"Good color variety, easy application, keeps brows looking great all day. Con is that pencil side outlasts the gel side and you loose too much product"
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Krissy","Cincinnati, Ohio",4,"This is really dark and can look really harsh if applied to heavily. I sometimes go over it with a brush to soften the look. I haven't used the gel because I don't need it."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","StudioNC42","Los Angeles, CA",4,"Great brow product. The pencil is not too creamy or hard. The gel is a little sheer, but it does hold the color in place."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Joitall","Charlotte NC",5,"The added brow wand is an excellent feature to shape the brows and provides a final blend. Just be careful not to apply too much."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Cattitude_7","Lancaster, NY",2,"The concept of this brow enhancer is great and it does a great job, however, I will not be purchasing again.  The first few times I used it I kept looking around the see if one of my cats urinated in my bathroom!  Seriously, I couldn't figure out why it smelled like cat pee in the bathroom until I just so happened to smell the brush applicator part of this product....omg there it was!  If they can change the smell of this then I definitely will buy again as it does what it is supposed to.  If you can get beyond the smell then it may be for you!"

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Rosegoldcoloredglasses","SLC, UT",4,"I really like this pencil and gel combo. They are very easy to use and it's nice to have them in the same place. I really like this color because my hair/brows are light brown/auburn, so I can't do them too dark or else I'll look like a drag queen. The only negative comment I have is that the gel can be too light and look really strange if you put too much on. Using a light hand with the gel is best."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Pumpkin Butter","Atlanta, Ga",3,"I got this because my sister uses it (she has very thick brows so the gel is great for her) It didnt do much for me and the kohl portion was not rich enough to give my brows the neat definition I like, but its ok."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","shoegal","Atlanta, GA",4,"This is a good brow pencil.  The product all day for me.  I also like the setting gel though frequently use only the pencil.  I like that it is a two in one product so good for travel.  The only criticism I have which keeps me from rating this 5 stars is that I feel like the way the pencil is in the plastic casing makes sharpening difficult and my last one the pencil fell out of packaging."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Susan","San Antonio, TX",3,"The gel works to color and control your brows.  The pencil pigment is such that you have to go over it more than once.  I have thinning brows due to aging so this works to fill in sparse areas."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","Mars","Millville, NJ",2,"I love the concept of this duo for eyebrows but really, it doesn't deliver.  My biggest complaint is that the liquid part does nothing. You put it on and all it does is add a bit of color.  It doesn't help to maintain the shape of your brows throughout the day.  Also the liquid side lasts above and beyond the pencil so you are stuck with a half used brow pencil duo in your makeup drawer because the pencil has worn out and can't be sharpened anymore.  That is so frustrating, I have to say!  Not worth the money.  You are better off buying the two seperate."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-fantasy-pencil-gel?productId=VP00195","I try it all!","Southeast US",3,"Pigment was a bit light, though I bought the darkest they make; the degree of pigmentation was good.   My hair is light brown with lots of highlighting, and I still felt the darkest wasn't quite dark enough.  Easy to use the pencil portion; gel was clumpy- I always had to get a spare/clean eyebrow brush to comb through the gel after applying"

It goes on easily and quick. The only thing I don't like is that it can smudge right after application, it takes a while to dry. Other than that, I love it!"

I exchanged it for light brown and it wasn't much better. It's difficult to get enough color from the pencil. The liquid end wand was awkward and sticky. Thumbs down on this."
