"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","fuzzy kitty","Utah",2,"Was cakey and oily. Was difficult to get it to conceal acne because it would smear off when I tried to blend it in."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","cjehtland","Midlothian, Texas",5,"Second time to purchase - this will be one of my go to's"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Chloe","Springfield, MO",2,"I wanted to cover my acne spots with this concealer, but it's not creamy at all. It is pretty dry so it looks cakey with foundation. Not worth the 11 dollars."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Gess","Orlando",4,"Ii use this product under my eyes, than went over it with contour palate from Anastasia."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Michelle","Las Vegas, NV",5,"This is so soft and creamy, goes on smoothly and stays on. Really evens out skin tone..."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","b1293","Bakersfield",3,"I would rate this product a 5, but it made my under eyes very glittery &amp; it also would settle into my creases :/ other than that it is a pretty good concealer"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","KatHoop","Texas",2,"I purchased 001 as I am a very fair skinned redhead.  The color matched well but coverage was minimal and the product was very creamy.  It did settle into creases a bit (I'm over 50).  Unless you have dry skin, it will probably be too creamy (not oily) for you."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","RGS","Edinburg tx",5,"A thing about this product is that it's so easy to use."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Abbey Daily","Seattle, WA",4,"I apply this concealer before applying foundation. I just dot it on blemishes and easily draw lines to blend under my eyes. It blends very well, I just wish it stayed in place better. That said, it's solid coverage and very natural looking. I'd definitely recommend it as a drugstore concealer."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Teach","Oviedo",3,"This made my eye area look flaky. I'm trying it with moisturizer over as a last ditch effort before returning it."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Hannah","texas",5,"I use this as a base for my eyeshadow everyday. I just put it all over blend it in and then set it with some airspun and it works amazinggggg. No creases through out the day and I have super oily eyelids. Such a great duo these two!!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Jane the very organized.","Dallas, Texas",5,"I have used Photoready since it came out. I have liked it ever since. Photoready is the best concealear. I wear it everyday. Consistently perfect, not too oily, not too dry. It blends easy, no clumps or streaks.It lasts all day. It looks natural with my skin. Problem is: stores run out of it everytime i need a new one. Thankfully Ulta had a good selection at a competitive price."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","BB","Glendale, CA",1,"It doesn't cover dark circles or skin imperfections and it dries out the skin making it look even worse!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Makeup mayhem","Sacramento, CA",4,"This concealer works very well and stays on well. I just wish there was a lighter color because I'm basically a snow ball."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Sara","Arlington",2,"I tried so hard to make this work but it looks flaky and horrible under the eyes, and is a cakey mess on blemishes. The worst part might be the flecks of glitter in the concealer- not cute."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Or nurse","SC",5,"Use rveryday for under eye. Will probably work fine for other problem areas."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Debbie the teacher","Evanston, IL",4,"I think this is the best under-eye coverage I've ever found.  It doesn't look too light, it blends nicely."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","kaymichelle","Colorado",1,"This color is so blotchy and it fades after a few hours of wear. Would not recommend this to anyone AT ALL."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Liz P","Storrs, CT",5,"I use this under my eyes, around my nose, and on other red/pigmented spots on my face. It does the job and blends well. It seems like it is a bit oily and that comes apparent around midday once it's been on a while but that may be just because of my skin type."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Alex","Hobbs, nm",5,"T zone and under eyes"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","ldt","Kalamazoo, MI",4,"Remember to blot with fingers when blending. If you rub it doesn't cover."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Rachel","Evansville, IN",5,"This is my go-to everyday concealer. I mainly use it for under eyes but it works on blemishes as well. It offers full coverage but feels sheer. It does require a setting powder under the eyes to prevent settling in lines and creases. I like NYX banana powder."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Lulu","Orlando,Florida",5,"Great touch"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","ADragonfly","Ohio",5,"I just dab this on and blend out then cover with my mineral makeup.  I have used more costly products.  Really this this is every bit as good.  It covers my under eye circles without showing under my makeup.  And, stays in place!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Dale","Macon,GA",5,"REALLY love this concealer! Cover really well, and is NOT cakey or unnatural looking at all. The only issue is if you want to wear the concealer alone, It as a bit of glitter in it. BUT if used under foundation it doesn't show."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","optichic","detroit,mi",5,"I have had awful skin after my son was born and this has really been the only thing that has been able to cover it all up! It blends really well, but I ran through it fairly quickly...granted I do have to use a bit more than 'normal'."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","krid","NorCal",4,"This item was part of the buy one receive one half off. Thought I'd try it and I really like it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Tapdancer","PA",2,"I'm generally quite pale, so I bought the &quot;light&quot; shade. What a mistake! It looks bright white on my skin, and takes three layers to cover my dark  circles anyway. When I swatched it at the store, it looked fine- but when I got home, to my dismay, I noticed shimmery particles.<br /><br />I would have bought the next shade, but it looked much too dark. The shade selection is poor...But, I decided that it wasn't enough time for me to judge the product so quickly, so I wore it to my friend's party. I concealed a blemish or two with it, as well as my undereyes. In photos, anywhere the concealer had touched looked GHASTLY white and shiny. My pimples stood out so badly. It looked like I had put whiteout on them.<br /><br />After wearing this for three days, I got clusters of little pimples around my browbone. I don't use brow pencil or foundation there, but I did use this concealer to hide veins and discoloration.<br /><br />I've never been so upset with a Revlon product! For something that claims to be &quot;photoready&quot;-well, I disagree with that. I was shocked to see all the positive reviews! This concealer does NOT deserve them."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","AmirsMama","Glenolden, Pa",4,"This concealer was very easy on my wallet! which i loved, however it is a little light but it blends well and i am able to mix it with a corrector that i have and it gets the job done. i wear this product alone with just a setting powder and its amazing, covers my dark spots very well!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Vic","Fredericksburg, VA",5,"I love this! I put it on blemishes and under my eyes then use a concealer brush to blend it out, and it looks perfect!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Michele","Palatine Bridge NY",5,"The formula is creamy enough to glide on and the medium matches my skin tone really well.  It's easy to blend it without tugging.  This is my second time purchasing.  I've tried TONS of concealers and this one is my go to."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Jenny","FL",3,"I love the look of this cover-up but, the shades are either too light or too dark.  I don't use foundation so I really need it to match.  <br />It still looks good with the right finishing powder."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Kate","Waukesha, WI",5,"I heard this concealer was comparable to a top-line brand, so I purchased it.  DEFINITELY love it, and have repurchased!It's creamy and blendable.  Covers discoloration (acne marks) very well.  I wear a foundation on top of this.  Can also be used to touch up if the spots show through throughout the day.For [$], it's amazing!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Alex","San Francisco, CA",5,"It's very easy to apply and matches my skin tone! It's compact so you can take it anywhere. I use this for blemishes, under my eyebrow, and under my eyes... it works perfectly!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","RachLea","Wichita, KS",3,"I generally use Too Faced's Absolutely Flawless concealer in Vanilla but decided to try this because it was half the price. Unfortunately, the coverage just isn't what I need/want/am accustomed to. It goes on smoothly but it just doesn't cover well. The only place I use concealer is under my eyes and this just isn't what I prefer to use. Would probably be good for someone who wants light coverage and a really creamy texture."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Nuni","Phoenix, AZ",2,"The actual product itself was alright, however, the applicater mechanism locked up on it's own and then once unlocked, the concealer stick was all crooked! I was worried that it would wind up breaking off. Very disappointed! I returned it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Jojo","NJ",5,"The formulation is perfectly smooth - glides on like butter. The ''Light Medium'' shade is the most close to my actual skin tone that I have seen in drugstore concealers thus far. The coverage is great though certain types of discoloration may need a few re-applications. It blends amazingly. Works great as an eye primer, or for nude lips. Does NOT dry out! That's my fave thing about it! It also conceals very well. I use this under my mineral powder foundations without an issue. Just don't go to heavy in wrinkled or creasy areas, as with any cream based product. Try it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","psychoanalyst","San Diego, CA",4,"I usually only splurge on eyeliner because it's for my eyes. However, I have tried hourglass and bobbi brown for concealer and this product competes very decently against them. It's also very affordable, which I love. But the shade of this concealer doesn't blend that well with the exact color of my skin. It does its job hiding my bags though."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","40Femme","Robertsdale, AL",4,"These tons of concealers out there &amp; most make us crazy because we feel like we wasted money on them... not this one though. it works like some of my higher-end concealers but makes me feel better about my wallet after purchasing it.<br /><br />I do not use it alone on my under-eye area, this for me works better as a heavy-duty concealer for difficult to cover areas. Works rather well around the nose, and on some large pore/acne scar areas.  It also works so well as an eye-shadow base. Thats one of my primary purposes &amp; it kills at it! (scar on brow bone- completely covers)<br /><br />{Again: It may be too 'draggy'on sensitive undereyes... but that's not why I buy this one.} This is truly for those hard to hide places/flaws--&gt; for HEAVY-DUTY covering it is the BEST! Does not look cakey and can be layered to get the desired coverage needed."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","BEGEE","Phx AZ",4,"Price is right"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Carol in Texas","Plano, TX",5,"The tube has a one-at-a-time click to move product up out of tube, so you don't have to worry about it moving up too far.  The distinct shape of the tube of product is perfect for easy application.  This is the best new product in a long time!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Chells","Seattle, WA",3,"Pros: Love the creamy consistency.<br />Good coverage.<br /><br />Cons: Settles into fine lines.<br />Creases with in a few hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","sb","mn",2,"too thick for under eye area"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","LaLaBarrios","Fremont, CA",4,"I have oily, tan, acne-prone skin and this product worked well!<br /><br />I have discoloration and spots on my face and jawline from acne and this product did a good job covering it up! Not completely but it was medium to heavy coverage. I use this on my cheeks, under my eyes, a little on my chin, and a little on my forehead.<br /><br />Under my eyes I noticed it got flakey and would settle in the creases because my under eye area was dry so make sure your skin is moisturized and healthy! I got my first ever eye cream because I never noticed my under eye area was dry until I used this product!<br /><br />This product would feel heavy but maybe that's just me because I usually only wear poweder. I only use concealer if I feel like looking extra special. This product would work best on normal to oily skin rather than dry skin. If you have dry skin I would suggest exfoliating before using this product or using moisturizer.<br /><br />The appllication was very easy but when you keep rubbing the stick of concealer on your face bacteria can breed on the product and cause acne. The concealer is very creamy though, and easy to blend. :)<br /><br />I only gave it four stars because it felt heavy on my skin, got cakey when I got oily, and it got flaky and settled in my creases under my eyes."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Leslie","Jacksonville, FL",3,"This concealer is better used as a touch up stick for me. I am medium olive complexion and have dark circles. I use this underneath my regular concealer for extra coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Jamie","Baltimore, MD",3,"It was okay it just i have bad skin and it did not work for bumpy pimply skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","abmnik","Chicago",4,"I like this concealer, I've been using it for about a year now. Unfortunately, i'm between two colours but that's not too great  a deal.<br />Be warned, this concealer can look cakey if not aplied carefully. It's not very buildable but it gives enough coverage in one layer that it doesn't matter. I don't use it under the eyes because it can crease a little, and anyhow I prefer something very light for under the eyes. I primarly use this concealer for hyperpgimentation. It works very well (I use a fluffly blending brush/crease brush)."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","lilu","boston",2,"Do not attempt to cover under eye circles with it. It simply does not work for that. The concealer settles into lines and creases.<br />But it does cover blemishes ok."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Ginger27","Roseville, CA",4,"Shades run darker than I expected. Use it as a great coverup and match to your foundation. Primarily use it for discoloration scars and blemishes."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Sugarcayna","Dallas, Texas",4,"I put this on before and after I use my foundation.  It actually lasts pretty good thru the whole day, as long as you're not touching your face alot of course.  I wish I would have bought this years ago!<br />It's important to get the right skin tone color.  I got the wrong one by mistake and Ulta let me exchange it, thanks Ulta!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Meg","Raleigh, Nd",2,"I bought this concealer when I brought a relvon foundation so that the colors would match, but I have always hated it! It was way over price considering it doesn't cover up anything. I put it one in the morning and it is fine, but within an hour my problem areas are back!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Jenny","Columbia, MO",4,"For starters, it has sturdier packaging compared to most drugstore brand concealers. As far as the actual concealer goes, it's high pigment, covers well, has a nice creamy texture, and stays on extremely well for a drugstore brand (especially when paired with a primer or powder foundation). <br /><br />The only negative thing? Compared to less-rich concealers it may slightly settle in creases or dry skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","JamieW","Utah",1,"I love the idea of a concealer in stick form so it is easier to apply.  However, this product was so disappointing.  It goes on thick, but doesn't very well at all.  i used it for dark under eye circles and was so displeased.  Ir settled into my creases and looked dry and cakey (even when applied very thinly).  It also was a terrible color for my skin tone.  Revlon face products seem to be very yellow based and as the shades get darker, they just get more orange. It looked very unnatural on my pink-toned skin.  I thought this was a very poor product for the price."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Beauty &amp; Makeup","Oxnard, CA",5,"I really like this concealer. I usually use it after putting my foundation on to cover blemishes or dark spots that are still showing, it covers really well. It blends well and it doesn't wear off. I had previously purchased a similar but high end product and I can say that this Photo Ready Concealer does the same job at a much lower price."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","AKteal","Anchorage, AK",5,"This was recommended by DulceCandy87 on Youtube. I love it! Works perfectly for under-eye circles and t-zone. Goes on super smooth and is easy to blend!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Prisp","Pico Rivera",4,"I love this concealer. Its very affordable and the coverage is great. I have a lot of blemishes and this product covers them all! The only con I have with this is that it doesn't last very long, but its easy to carry everywhere so its not problem at all!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Glam Ellie","Cortland, NY",5,"Goes on so smoothly it feels wonderful on the delicate under eye area."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Joan","Itasca, IL",4,"Quick &amp; Easy !!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Sabrina","Rock Island, IL",4,"Finally a concealer that blends it to my skin. I have very fair skin and no matter how light it seems I go on concealer, they always seem to show up orange on my skin. This one actually blends in and looks natural. I wish the staying power was a little better but it's not bad (I'm just really picky) and since I can actually use it it's a definite win for me."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","VegasChick88","Las Vegas, NV",4,"Smooth application, build-able coverage, true to color. Its great for the price. I usually rotate between this and my Clinique and Benefit. Doesn't have as strong of coverage and the higher brands but is worth the extra over other brands I've tried like Cover Girl and Mabelline."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","MK","Chicago, IL",3,"I use the product to cover dark circles.  I believe the lipstick like application works very well."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","Sarah","Chicago, IL",5,"I really liked this concealer for under my eyes. It did not keep my acne scars covered, but over all was good coverage. It didn't dry out my skin or make it greasy. The only other thing I could complain about was that it creased a bit and I had to rub that out after about 15 minutes, and then I was good to go!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","cat0711","Waxahachie, TX",3,"I was disappointed in this product.  The coverage is not great and it doesn't seem to cover much."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod2940201","no nickname","Minneapolis",4,"Hard to get the color right, but for the price, it's a pretty good product. Goes on easily...good texture. Looks a little cakey, but not any worse than the higher priced ones.

I've been using this for a while, and I have never noticed any kind of shimmer. Mine is matte. I am very shimmer-averse, and if there was anything resembling shimmer in this product, I'd chuck it... Maybe they've changed the formula since I bought mine? <br /><br />This product is creamy and blend-able. It melts into the skin when blended with the fingers and looks natural. It's full coverage and can cover up ANYTHING. I have loved this concealer for a while now.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give it five stars is because it lacks staying power. It lasts longer with primer and a setting powder, but touch ups may be in order by, say, 3 or 4 PM. But I don't really mind, because it still looks good after touching up, and the stick packaging makes touch ups easy.<br /><br />This is a wonderful concealer for blemishes, redness, spots, etc. It may settle into lines around the eyes, however, so I wouldn't use it for the undereye area."

So after blending all my makeup I take a peak at under my eyes and there's some of the makeup just chillin' there. So I have to take my finger and blend it again, knowing in the back of my head that that is going to keep happening. Also it doesn't even match my skin tone well. Overall, I mean..it covers well.

I do not use concealer under my eyes as I don't have dark circles.  However I need concealer to cover up a bunch of redness on my face and my nose.  My skin flares very very red lately.  All the green stuff does no good either.  So I use this over my foundation on my cheeks and nose and wherever I see redness/rosacea.  It covers so much better than my foundation and the finish is better too.  Hides/blurs my pores and fine lines.  My skin looks flawless with this.  I actually was looking into the stick foundation in this line hoping it would be the same thing in a bigger tube that I can just use as foundation. It got mixed reviews though so I am not sure about it.<br /> The only con is it does wear off mid day and I have to apply more.  But it's super easy to carry with you and re- apply during the day so it's not a big deal."

The first shade was too pink, so I opted for the next shade, light, just like I have to do with the ColorStay foundation. The light shade is much much much too yellow.<br /><br />However, it went on my skin (undereye area) the perfect shade. It went on smoothly, covered well, and then it changed... After about twenty minutes I looked in the mirror and it was dry, flaky, and had turned an awful orange color.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great idea, that wasn't executed very well.

I don't know why I was under the impression that this would be even remotely good, because it's just absolutely horrendous.<br /><br />I might have excused the fact that it had shimmer, had it actually been easy to apply, or did a good job concealing, but it did neither of those things. <br /><br />I initially tried applying it with my finger, and it was really awkward, it caused me to tug a lot on my under eye just to spread it out evenly. I even tried with a make up sponge, and it still didn't apply as evenly as I had hoped.<br /><br />Then, not only did it apply terribly, the shimmer made it obvious I had make up on, AND it settled right into my creases.<br /><br />The only good thing about this would probably be the fact that it didn't wear off easily. <br /><br />Bottom line, don't even waste your money on this if you're hoping for a good concealer."

Most drug stores will not carry a variety of colors. Ulta carries deep and medium deep in photo ready concealers. I tried out medium deep which is a little orange and yellowish but applied on amazing and blended well with my Mac  foundation and BB cream by L'Oreal . Just make sure to sit it with a translucent powder lightly.  Medium deep is 005 which I am not that dark so not sure why medium 004 didn't work for me . My suggestion is make sure you by the right color if one is too light or the coverage isn't great try one shade up even if it looks a little dark."

Shade 001 in this stick concealer matches my skin perfectly. It took me a long time to really understand this concealer because it is difficult to blend and makes creases obvious- if you tap with your finger the concealer just disappears or ends up being cakey and obvious. Now I use my beauty blender and blend around the outside of the blemish so it looks decent. This works well over blemishes my foundation can't cover.

But since I have a pretty good foundation, I don't really need to use as much concealer. <br /><br />I love how easy it is to apply. I just put some underneath my eyes, and dab at it with my ring finger and it blends in perfectly. It stays on for the entire day. <br /><br />I dislike how it does not cover redness as well. I am lucky my foundation helps a lot with that. It also feels cakey at time, but that might be due to how long I've had it and how much I apply. <br /><br />Overall, I love how easy to apply and how it stays on the entire day, but I dislike how it doesn't cover redness and the cakey feeling I get from time to time."

The formula is very creamy so it is a dream to blend. It's very convenient and lasts a lot longer and wears off gradually compared to my liquid concealers. I wanted to try stick concealers for summer because they supposedly last a lot better and I think that is true.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the product has tiny shimmery particles in it which is not noticeable in indoor lighting, but once I went outside in sunlight, wherever I applied it glittered like crazy in the sun, which makes me kind of sad because I thought I had found my holy grail concealer.
