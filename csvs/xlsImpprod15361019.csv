"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Boots","Tallahassee, FL",5,"I like this product as it is easy to apply. The brush helps blend in the color as I fill in my brows."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Wolfpack14","United states",3,"I love this brow pencil and my friend actually recommended it, but while I was using it on the second use, the top broke off!  I have very light brows to begin with and therefore I apply anything to my eyebrows lightly so the stick must be pretty fragile to break off with my gentle touch. It broke off clean so now I have to try to make a new angle on the top. Disappointed with the fact that it broke off!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","gapch","Whitehall, PA",5,"I am ashy blonde and when I purchased this I thought the blonde might be too light BUT it ended up matching perfectly!  I love it.  So far it is the best eyebrow pencil I have tried.  It goes on easy and it stays put and is easy to remove.  My eyebrows look natural and not drawn on.<br />Love it!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Tj","MS",2,"The product is pretty simple but I wouldn't recommend it for long term wear. It's great for a beginner who needs to learn"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Whit","Oklahoma",1,"It was way to thick of a pencil. Best if you have no eyebrows at all"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Marisuz","South Florida",5,"I have used many eyebrow products, and aside from Wunderbrow, this is my next choice! It goes on smooth, has a great natural color (soft black) and lasts alllll day even when sweating. It says it's waterproof but it does come off rather easily when I wash my face with facewash, which is a good thing. The tip is angled so you can outline the brow with the finer side and fill them in with the thicker side."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Ugh","Washington",1,"Thought I would try a new eyebrow pen, boy did I make a mistake. Goes on clumpy and thick and makes my eyebrows look very unattractive"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Peaches","Wilmington, NC",2,"I love the colorstay lipsticks but this eyebrow pencil does not deliver that stay on quality like the lipsticks. If you touch your face at all it comes off."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Bulldogmama","Union Beach, NJ",5,"Do you know how hard it is to find brow color for a redhead? There aren't many choices outside of the brunette and blond world.  Auburn isn't too popular. This pencil is perfect for my color- just red enough to darken my eyebrows but not so red it looks artificial.  Plus it has a beveled point making it easier to apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","no nickname","Minneapolis",2,"The tip on this is too broad.  It's hard to get a fine, natural application."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","lkc","il",4,"but on fair side of medium"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","TC","Nashville, TN",4,"This product is amazing! Very smooth formula. So easy to apply. But DO NOT use the spoolie it comes with! It's extremely rough and leaves the skin around my brows red and irritated."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Ashley","CT",1,"I use Anastasia's Brow Wiz but wanted to try some cheaper alternatives. I usually Makeupalley for reviews, as I've found reviews on this app/site to be very inaccurate, but for some reason skipped doing my research. Big mistake. I picked up this pencil, and the L'Or&eacute;al version of the brow wiz. The L'Or&eacute;al version is GREAT! This pencil is a nightmare. The tip is EXTREMELY imprecise- it's so big! It is way too creamy and wide enough to be an eyeliner. I'm very experienced with makeup, but when I was done with my brows they looked like they were drawn on by a teenager. I cannot stress enough how terrible this brow &quot;pencil&quot; (crayon) is. If you're looking for an ABH brow wiz dupe, or just a natural, clean finished look, skip this pencil and go for the L'Or&eacute;al twist up pencil instead!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Katie","Olathe, KS",5,"I love how easy this is to fill in my brows for everyday wear. I hate spending a ton of time on brows unless it's for a night out. This fills them in quickly without a ton of precision work. Love the blonde shade, it's not super yellow like others I've tried."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Nicole","Las Vegas",1,"The color is pretty pigmented so you have to use a light hand with it even then the pencil will just break off. It broke off twice should have just waited to buy the Nyx eyebrow pencil."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Saranneb","Charlotte, NC",2,"First, this is a really thick pencil, keep in mind. I'm used to the micro pencils, so trying this out was a pain. Second, the color selection was off for me. I have a medium brown hair color, so the light brown was too light and the dark brown is almost black. I chose the dark brown. Third, the pigmentation is yes very strong, but it's also very waxy and sits on the skin in a non natural way, and rubs off very easily. It's streaky and chunky and not natural. I would suggest the NYX micro pencil if you're going for drugstore pencils."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Izzy","Az",1,"This product makes ur brows feel chocky sore of. The led is rectangler ands difficult <br /> to line or fill in your brow."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Roielle","Detroit, MI",5,"It is more of a waxy consistency than a pencil. I think that's what makes it waterproof. The spooly helps keep it a natural look. This is great for me during the summer when I tend to be oily."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Bren","Clayton, NC",4,"Smooth application and appears natural."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Mik","Ontario, CA",3,"The colour was pigmented, however this product does not last very long. I don't use this product everyday, and I ran out less than a 2 months using it. <br />The colour comes out a bit clumpy on the eyebrow hairs and you can definitely see specs in it. <br />Won't buy again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Jayme","Portland Maine",5,"I have a pesky eyebrow that doesn't fill in at the start so it looks naturally like I have a bald spot in the beginning. This is easy to apply especially when I'm too tired to get up!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Leelee","CA",2,"I wouldn't recommend on oily skin. By the end of they day my eyebrows were gone."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Gigi","Phoenix",5,"I outline my eyebrows with this product then use my Anastasia Brow powder, and finish up with my Maybelline brow gel. I love the way my eyebrows look when I am finished. Being over 40 with thinning brows this helps me look like I have more natural looking eyebrows."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","OCMom","Orange County, Ca",1,"I've tried other brow pencils but this one wasn't my favorite. It went on a little too waxy and clumpy for me. Won't be buying again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Angie","Wisconsin",5,"I use this product everyday day and I love it. I have sensitive skin and I don't have any allergic reaction with this brow pencil and it looks fresh and great on me."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","SAllgood","St Joseph MO",2,"When you apply it, it literally looks like you drew on your skin with a Crayola crayon. I didn't like it at all."

This pencil glides on so nice and my daughters have both told me my eyebrows look very natural. P.S. don't let this one go!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Sue the makeup lover","Hartford CT",5,"Brush-on brow products just weren't cutting it - this allows me to shape and blend."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Tina","Atlanta, GA",5,"What an amazing product! A nice ashy tone (I purchased the Deep Brunette) and it matches well with my dark brown hair color. It applies nicely and doesn't dry out! I had been using Anastasia for a while, but realized the tone was too red and also the NYX micro brow pencil but it would dry out to fast. This one is the best one so far AND it's cheaper. I paired this with the gel (which is okay, I prefer the Anastasia gel over this one). But I'd recommend this! And it doesn't fade or smudge throughout the day."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Page","D.C.",3,"I really like the application and look- unfortunately it is completely the wrong color. Their version of auburn turned out to be much closer to a dark brown and looks completely unnatural."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Emily","Indianapolis",3,"I just bought this to get me through until my new ABH Brow Wiz arrived. I used it for the first time this morning and while the product is very creamy, it's almost too creamy and can easily make a mess of your brows. However, I can make the product work with my brows, it just takes more time than my trusty ABH brow wiz. This product isn't terrible, just not my favorite."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-brow-pencil?productId=xlsImpprod15361019","Emma","Madisonville, LA",4,"I love the brush it comes with, but not a fan of the actual brow wax pencil. It applies very dark and doesn't give me that natural eyebrow look I like."
