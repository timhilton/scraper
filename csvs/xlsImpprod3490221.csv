I've gone through several pairs that look good but didn't work. These do the job and are nice looking. Good for brows and other areas of the face. Will grip thickers hairs like the brows, or thinner hair like the downy fuzz on the chin. I keep these in my car, and when I forget them it's depressing."

It doesn't matter how much I baby them with care, (not just these Revlon tweezers), they always get out-of-whack and they are useless on my eyebrows. Ugh!"

"http://www.ulta.com/designer-collection-slanted-tweezers?productId=xlsImpprod3490221","Outgoing1","Santa Rosa, CA",4,"I am obsessed with removing the hair on my face, and use tweezers every day.  I have tried other popular brands and return those and use the Revlon slant.  I rotate 4-5 tweezers at a time."

"http://www.ulta.com/designer-collection-slanted-tweezers?productId=xlsImpprod3490221","Treble09","Minneapolis, MN",5,"Revlon's brand of tweezers are hands down, the best I've ever used.  Personally I've never paid more than the 7 or 8 dollars for Revlon's brand tweezers, so I can't compare them to Tweezerman, but these slanted tip style are exactly what I need.  They grip on perfectly, and theres always a clean finish!  I buy this brand again and again."

I haven't been satisfied with any of them; but this one works!  I just get my magnification mirror and start plucking; pretty soon my eyebrows look great! (and it's SO much cheaper than waxing or threading!)"
