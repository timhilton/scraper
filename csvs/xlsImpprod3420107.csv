"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Hairlicious","tucson az",5,"Worth every penny!"
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","KiraJ07","NY",4,"This helps me shape my brows and trim away any strays.  The brush is great too.  Sometimes, it's difficult for me to angle the scissors for a proper trim but I don't think this has anything to do with the design."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Ice Skater","Compton, Ca",5,"The  scissors are super sharp and very light. The grips inside the handles are great, they help take a firm hold. The brush is very soft, more than I expected. The set made the trimming of my eyebrows quick and easy. They're thin enough to be allow you to easily see how much you're trimming off your eyebrow."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","orangesky","Chicago, IL",5,"Don't waste your money on more expensive scissors.  These will do the trick just fine.  I like Revlon for all of my grooming tools."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Mich","San Francisco, CA",5,"Love the quality on the scissors.  Cuts great!  The brow brush is also pretty good quality. Tames my crazy brows really well."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","G","Texas",5,"Good product."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","HeidiHeartsSkincare","Louisiana",5,"These scissors are great. For the price you can't beat them. They come with a pretty red grip on the finger loops of the scissors. Which was great for me because I'm clumsy and it prevents slipping. They are very sharp and easy to get around the curves of my eyebrows. I could even use these to trim baby hairs or split ends. I didn't care much for the spoolie that came with them. It was kind of flimsy, so if you're buying these for the spoolie. Then I suggest you move on to another product. If you're buying them for the scissors then I definitely suggest these."

"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Sienna","Iowa",5,"I have to keep up with my eyebrows constantly. I was spending so much money on getting them waxed because I was afraid I'd destroy my eyebrows. It took a little practice to find the best way to use it but I'm so happy that I took the chance. I use this set a lot and I'd recommend it to anyone."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Kay the mua","Salisbury, MD",5,"Cuts nicely and accurately."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Hannah","Kentucky",5,"I use it every morning and night to reshape my brows and change growth pattern."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Abby","Atlanta",2,"I purchased this product because my previous Revlon spiral  brush that I had for years was beginning to get worn from use.  The quality of the new one is not even close to the older one.  The bristles on the new one are shorter and not as sturdy and will never hold up for long term use like the older one.  In addition, I did not need the scissors and only purchase the product because I needed to replace my spiral brush.  The brush used to be sold separately but is now sold with the scissors as a set.  I cannot recommend this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Undertaking","Biloxi, ms",5,"I mainly bought this duo for the spool brush, but the scissors are excellent. Super sharp and easy to maneuver. The spool brush is great as well. Takes the unruly mess I have easily. I use the spool every day."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","Mimi","va",4,"I use this product daily."
"http://www.ulta.com/brow-set?productId=xlsImpprod3420107","hewwogillian","Fayetteville, AR",5,"This set is perfect for eyebrow grooming. The scissors are easy to hold and work great."
