"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","GiGi","Lakeland, FL",5,"I bought this is Coquette and love it. This is a shimmery color, which i don't mind, but it's worth mentioning. This goes on very smooth and seems to stay that was for some time, but I feel that the color comes off easier for that reason. Overall, a good buy!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Kate","WA",5,"Is very moisturizing and lasts surprisingly long on my lips. I don't usually like shimmery lip products, but this one just looks shiny and glossy once applied, and provides a sheer but noticeable wash of color. One of my new favorite lip looks. The shade &quot;Demure&quot; is the perfect light nude-pink shade for me; it's my go-to for everyday wear."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","dc","Wantagh,NY",4,"Love the color choices and the color in the package was true to how it looked when applied."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Sucker for Style","Montpelier, VT",5,"This winter has been harsh on my lips. I was trying Burt's Bees tinted balm for a while and my lips were actually sloughing off in sheets. It was incredibly embarrassing. I dont care for heavy lipsticks, just a nice shine with a light tint. This balm feels so good going on and really soothes. The shape is perfect for application and with this range of colors I think I found my new go-to!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Katie T","Birmingham, AL",3,"When I bought this, I was looking for a product with good pigmentation but easier than a lipstick. That's exactly what you'll get with this product. My only problem is that it is not very long lasting."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Chloe","Chicago, IL",3,"I really like it, but there is some glitter in it, which is not really my style. I like it otherwise. It feels really good and seems to last well."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Courtney","Philadelphia  Pa",5,"Love the Revlon &quot;crayon &quot; style stains and balms. Long lasting and they don't easily dry out. My lips are often chapped, but these colors still look great! Highly recommend for those who don't want to worry about smudging all day. Stays in place very well. You also have the flexibility to make it lighter for day or more vibrant for night."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","JodiG","Ozark, MO",4,"I like the moisture in this.  Subtle color is good for daily use."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Julia","Medina, OH",4,"The product's color was great, but it didn't last long.  it was just a nice colored shine, which is good enough for me."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Lynn","Houston",4,"I bought this in vivacious and flirtatious but had to return them. I'm not a fan of the glittery sparkles. I love the color in coy though. It's a my lips but better plus it's got a little shine, but it's not obviously sparkling out of my comfort zone. I do have to put a lip balm under it though. It's not moisturizing enough to fly solo and it's def not long lasting enough."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Gg10Les","Asheville,NC",4,"Great color and shine. Just the coverage I needed for envy day wear"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Ginas13","Brooklyn, NY",5,"I love these lip balms.  The other version were a bit too light in color.  This version really pops!  It feels really nice on as well."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Rez","Surprise, AZ, Arizona",5,"I use it every day and have one in my cosmetic drawer, purse, cart and golf cart. It glides on easily, doesn't bleed and feels great"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","skierbreezer","Provo, UT",4,"Really like these, but they do kind of change color after you apply them. They always go darker. If you're ok with that then they're great."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Czatina Kat","Atlanta, Ga",5,"I put it on before I leave for work in the morning and it lasts all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Beauty inside out","AZ",5,"Great product for the price but it wears off fairly quickly."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","HOOPurr","Virginia",5,"Now that I'm a bit older, I LOVE a pop of color on days that I don't look rested.  This color is amazing, the wear in incredible, and it's pretty comfy too.  On in the morning, sometimes a touch-up... more often not.  Terrific."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Larabrite","Long Beach, CA",5,"I have this lip crayon in &quot;provocateur femme fatale&quot; in the lacquer finish and it is just the best thing in all the ways... it is so easy to apply, the color is a truly magnificent red with a deep blue pink undertone so it doesn't fade to orange but retains its red. It does require reapplication but is lovely and non drying and smells pleasantly minty so it's no hardship to pop another coat on after eating or drinking."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Runnergirl","Maryville, IL",5,"I recently changed my naturally dark blond hair to red.  My usual makeup routine of a daytime smokey eye with neutral pinky or nude lips was not working so I tried this red.  I love the color.  Easy application.  I do have to reapply after eating but I am good with that.  It is what I expect with a product that has balm in the name.  I do also use a clear lip liner with this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Ivan's mom","Auburn WA",5,"I bought two of these lipsticks in different colors after a makeup artist used them on me. I love the smell and they don't taste bad either. <br />Not long lasting but that's ok for my style."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Judybop","Houston, Texas",4,"Love this lip balm. Just a hint of pink w/ a bit of sparkle."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Jenn","Houston, TX",5,"Both the original line of balm stain and the lacquer are non-drying! If you like SUPER shiny lips you might want to add gloss but these carry the perfect amount of shine for me. I do want to mention that the matte line is VERY DRYING. Revlon did an amazing job with the color choices and pay off. The color is pretty lasting,  some more than others. I personally have gone thry at least 3 of Honey (my go to every day lip)."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Deverfever","Napa, ca",5,"I love these. Easy to use. Look &amp; feel great on. I'm not a big lip makeup user because I tend to get annoyed with the way glosses and lipsticks feel &amp; the maintenance of it, but these work for me. I only wish they had more colors!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Taaaaaaaaaayyyyylllloooooooooorrr","New Orleans, LA",4,"I liked the lip stain in the color demure, the only thing i didnt like is that it had sparkles in it. other than that i had no problem!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Sunny","Fort Worth texas",3,"Overall good product, though you have apply a few coats for the color to  be more vibrant."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","skyclad","Springfield, MO",5,"I really liked this product. I ordered it in the &quot;Coquette&quot; color and it provides just a enough color with a touch of shimmer. The only downside is it is not long-lasting at all; I have to reapply every hour or so."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Rebecca Chinchilla","New York",4,"Beautiful colour and beautiful minty feeling. However, it fades after about an hour to an hour and a half if  you lick your lips fairly much."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Laura in Oregon","Corvallis, OR",2,"While this product has some great colors, I was very disappointed. Application is not smooth, it does not feel good on the lips (every wrinkle is apparent) and it fades very quickly."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","funsize","Utah",5,"I have this product in several colors, and so does my daughter.  We LOVE these.  They stay on, especially the matte colors.  They are true to the color they appear to be, and they feel like a nice lip balm.  This is the second time I have purchased this particular shade.  I used up the previous one."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","NicB","Orange County, Ca",5,"This stain balm works well, is portable and easy to use. It lasts a long time and is fun to play with. Great for beginners also. I have chapped lips and this was hydrating and did not make them worse."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Trish the wisest woman you know","Oakley, CA",2,"I bought these lip stains thinking that they, 1. moisturize, but they don't, don't last long, have to keep reapplying. I wear my burt's bees lip shine gloss over to moisturize. It doesn't live up to it's name, unfortunately."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","doglover","indiana",4,"I really like this. gives great shine and feels great but take it with you to reapply because it doesn't stay on very long. I really like this but gave it 4 stars for staying power"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Lipsticklover","New Castle NH",5,"Use a liner and this color stays on all night.  Very bright and excellent for a for a great party or night out!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","TT","FL",5,"I typically purchase higher end beauty brands, because I find the ingredients and quality much better. However, I saw this reviewed in a magazine and several makeup artists singing its praises, so I decided to give it a try. Was totally expecting to be disappointed, but was very pleasantly surprised!! I purchased No. 105 Demure, and it is the prettiest pale pink shade, perfect nude neutral with just a tiny hint of sparkle. I usually go for a more matte color, so this is not at all disco shiny! It is super moisturizing, not drying like some balms can be, and a little minty. All in all, I am a fan now, and would definitely purchase this again!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Judy","Willoughby, OH",5,"Great for extra color to your lips"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Meg","Bergen County, NJ",5,"I love this lip product.  I have it in a magenta and red color and the staying power is great.  I prefer this texture to lipstick because it doesn't feel as heavy and I like how it stains your lips a bit.  Highly recommend!  Much better than the versions other brands have of this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","KP","Atlanta, GA",4,"My favorite color from this line is Whimsical, which is a really nice bright berry pink color. For the most part I really like this product- the great color payoff, the minty taste, and the lasting power. <br /><br />The only thing I really don't like is the amount of glitter. You can't really &quot;feel&quot; the glitter but when the product eventually wears off you're left with glitter lips which I find annoying. <br /><br />Other than that I really like this product. I have worn this over matte lipsticks, over other longer lasting lip stains, and by itself. <br /><br />I prefer the Revlon Colorburst BALM STAINS which don't have glitter, but still give you a little shine, and the colors are just as nice."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Makeup Girl","Newyork",5,"These are absolutely amazing. They're highly pigmented, easy to apply and have a little bit of a minty smell to them which I personally love. I got it in the color whimsical and it is a beautiful purpuly shade. Nice job Revlon"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-lacquer-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010258","Makeup Lover","NY",5,"These lacquer balms are the best. They're super moisturizing and rich in texture. They go on smoothly and the color pigmentation is great. Also they do have a hint of minty smell but I think that's great"
