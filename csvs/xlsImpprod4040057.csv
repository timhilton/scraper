"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Kat","North Carolina",4,"I think this product is meant to be used on the eyelid but I mainly use it under my eyes to brighten dark circles, and then I layer concealer on top of it and it works pretty well for that."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Ash1018","PA",2,"The product works better as a highlighter, but still doesn't work well. After only three hours of wearing this, eyeshadow, and eyeliner, the shadow will be almost entirely off and the eyeliner will transfer. Not a good product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Tigress Dana","Raleigh, NC",5,"I have used this for years. I use it as a highlighter under my eyes and if I'm doing more contouring on my chin and nose."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Natural Woman","San Diego",1,"I got this to use as an eye primer, although I think it may have helped my eye shadow go on more smoothly, it unfortunately has little white &quot;chips&quot; in the formula. After putting it on my eyelids and under eye area, I had to use tweezers to remove all the &quot;white paint specks&quot;... so, THAT was not a look I was going for.  I don't know if it was just a bad batch?  or if all their primer is like this.  I will try once more and if I have repeat episode, will return to it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Chris","VA",3,"When applying, it did exactly as the tube read, brightening my eyes- and that part was really good! And when I applied eyeshadow over the product, I found that I was able to go a few hours without creases. However, 4 or so hours into the school day those pesky little creases would come back. Note that I have pretty oily skin, so that could be a factor, but still. This product would be great for day-to-day use for someone whose has drier skin that doesn't get super oily."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Kira O.","NY",2,"this product burned my eyelids, and it wasn't only me, my sisters tried it and they said it burned too.i've tried other primers and honestly there's a 2 dollar primer from e.l.f that is SO much better"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Jadie R","ND",2,"This product may work great if you have never used an eyeshadow primer. I was looking for something more base- like, so this thin, &quot;can't really see it on the lid&quot; formula was not for me. I returned it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","jbell118","fort worth tx",5,"This is y 2nd tube and it is GREAT! I have learned to just give a twist at a time and apply just a very thin coat - it will literally keep your shadow on for days if you want it to. BTW I have very sensitive skin and have never had an issue with this. Works way better than the expensive department store stuff."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","MEJ","New Jersey",3,"Creases too much"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","liv","CO",2,"Even though this primer does pigment my shadows a little more, i find creases about 3 hours after application, and my eyeshadow easily fades away with the primer on. I wouldn't recommend this if you were looking for long lasting eyeshadow primer."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Amy","Corpus Christi, TX",5,"I use this product under my eyes just about every day. I have to get up early every morning and my bedtimes aren't always the best. This primer makes me look less tired and is super easy to apply and layer on. The staying power isn't the best (for all day all night coverage) but I suspect using some Laura Geller or general make up primer would fix that."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Amber the Great","San Antonio, TX",2,"I was excited to try this product.  However, this primer left my eyelids very dry.  I was so distracted by the dry texture on my lids, I can't say if the primer extended the wear of my shadow."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Mendy","Fort Worth, TX",4,"This was onsale so I thought I'd give it a try. Was pleasantly surprised at the coverage and the natural look. Less is more.... I have sun spots and dark circles, it really brightened my eyes. I'm sold."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Lucy","Norristown, PA",4,"Great on dark areas"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Ardea","Pennsylvania",4,"This product is great as a highlighter when used in the corner of the eyes. It does a pretty good job as eye shadow primer but I do notice some creasing at the end of the workday. This product will sink into fine lines, and the applicator is annoying, but I like it enough that I will probably buy it again."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","jennys","nebraska",3,"nice base, I prefer the loreal but cannot seem find as easily. this is a great/cheaper substitute. I use instead of powder/color.  Just 'natural' look.  Sometimes my eyelid is mauve color. ?? either due to soaps/irritation or from time to time, the off color side effect of lattise.   This makes it more creamy."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","MommaP","Waterville Maine",2,"I was looking for a highlighting agent for under my eyes and contouring, although the product states it provides this, it does not. Considering returning it"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Kari","Pataskala OHIO",5,"This product is very smooth and light. It lightens the area around the eyes without drying it out or making you rub your sensitive under eye area too harshly.<br />LOVE IT!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Sarah","Fort Wayne, IN",3,"If you have been searching for a more pink-toned brightener, this is a great deal! The coverage for this pen is pretty good, and it is good for highlighting purposes. I use a blending sponge to blend it in with the rest of my makeup. You have to be careful getting too close to your eye, because it will crease on skin. All in all, it is not a cure-all for under eye bags/circles, but it does do a pretty good job brightening the skin by itself."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Lo","Omaha, NE",4,"I use daily. It helps to keep eyes from tearing and washing away eye color and mascara so color stays on longer."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","RRT","Dallas,tx",3,"Highlight my eye area; difficult to access and it's oily feeling"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","StAuggieLady","St. Augustine, FL",1,"I was looking for something a little cheaper to replace my Primer Potion. This is definitely not it. The product is slick and resistant to dry enough to apply eyeshadow on top. Even still, I tried to do my usual look and my liquid eyeliner barely stayed in place and all but refused to go on my lid. A few hours after walking out of the door my eyes were a complete mess. Absolute garbage."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","jbell118","fort worth tx",5,"I wasn't sure when I ordered it online but it was on sale so I thought I would give it a try. Extremely happy with it, you can put it on as light or heavy as you want and it glides on so smooth, so much better than those expensive &quot;pots&quot; of primer you have to apply with your finger and they dry out."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Amy","Corpus Christi, TX",4,"This primer/corrector is my go-to for under-eye circles. Blends nicely and doesn't feel too heavy or flake off."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","BRLighthouse","Lincoln, NE",5,"Great product - have used this for years and it is one of my favorites."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","NoNonsenseMama","Ca",1,"I just wanted a simple primer without breaking the bank but this one is a waste."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Busy mom","Duluth, MN",3,"I wanted eye primer and highlighter so I bought this and was a bit disappointed.. Looks good for a while but it dresses even without eye shadow."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Rosey B","Saint Louis, MO",3,"Bought this during a sale because I've been trying to up my everyday make up game - I do like how this brightens the under eye area - I wear glasses, and on days when I look tired and want to wear make up, this makes a huge difference for me. I just don't feel like it lasts through a work day, and I definitely don't use it for eyeshadow priming. I have oily lids and need something more heavy duty for that!<br /><br />But for running out the door to do groceries, shopping, brunch, weekend activities, I think it's a great product that helps me look more put together."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","allie","texas",5,"i use it to prime my eyelids and just to brighten my under eyes a tad bit and its great"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","JLo","Chicago",4,"Brightens your eyes! Perfect for everyday use and great when you did not get enough sleep and are seeing those dreaded dark circles."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","kdmakeup","Santa Fe NM",5,"use under eyes and on eyelids for eyeshadow primer"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Carly","North Carolina",5,"I've always had pretty bad dark circles under my eyes (genetic - thanks Mom!). They are the kind that even if I get 10 hours of sleep, I still look tired.  I picked this up after seeing it in an online makeup tutorial about hiding your dark circles.  Went ahead and tried it out and LOVE it.  It's not a miracle product by any measure, but it is a fantastic base product that I use under my Smashbox concealer for everyday tired looking eyes.  I also use Benefit's &quot;Eye Bright&quot; liner for my water line to lighten things up.  I would recommend this product as part of a dark circle coverup system, especially since it's a great price."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Lady Di","Federal Way, WA",5,"Use as a eyeshadow primer and shadow stays on all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Mari","Zion IL",5,"I like this product have had no problems."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","msp","Charleston, SC",2,"The twist and click application method seems to take too long to get the product to the brush for application. I'd rather just dip the wand in the cream and apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","bq","San Antonio",1,"I would not buy this product again.  I do like shopping for cosmetics at Ulta and I work in television.  This product was terrible and a waste of money"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Sammy LaLa","Richmond, va",1,"Bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to urban decay or too faced. You get what you pay for, I guess."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","mari","Zion IL",4,"Use all around the eyes to brighten them up"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Jen, mommy of two","Chicago, Il",4,"I am in my thirties with two little ones so sleep sometimes eludes me.  This stuff does a nice job of minimizing the dark circles while still looking natrual.  It does not totally eliminate it. But I feel it is pretty equilivant to some higher end products and it is less than half the price.  My only complaint is the container, it is hard to get just the amount of product I need."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","VT lover","MA",4,"Great for dark circles.  Don't love the mushy applicator but no biggy."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Chica","Inland Empire",2,"Primer a little difficult to apply with brush/pen it comes with.  I found it much easier to apply with finger and work from there."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","jabny","atlanta,ga.",3,"The product felt a bit cakey by the end of the day. It does intensify the color of the eyeshadow but does crease a little after a few hours, however I would still recommend it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","les","rockford, illinois",2,"i don't have dark circles,was just hoping for a little brightener. but i didn't notice a difference"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","KEKE","ST LOUIS, MO",1,"This product does not brighten or prime at all. My eye lids feel greasy and my eye shadows crease very quickly. The applicator is useless because it causes the &quot;primer&quot; to come out in globs and the brush doesn't blend the product well so you will still end up using your fingertips to blend. After a day at work, I cannot wait to get home to wash my face. I am going to return this product first thing in the morning"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Amy","Dallas, TX",1,"The product has a twisty thing at the bottom that I guess is supposed to push the liquid product inside the tube onto the brush in order to apply it.  I thought it was a stick product when I bought. Anyway, the liquid never came out of the tube and therefore I couldn't use it at all and returned the product to the store.  I am no longer interesting in gadget-types of makeup and am fed up with cheap products trying to be impressive!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Native New Ykr","Las Vegas",3,"Prefer Boots Concealer. Too much product comes out on brush when turning the applicator."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","barbmcg","Amherst, NY",1,"Didn't work at all. Stayed wet and didn't go on evenly."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","DesertRose","Tucson, AZ",5,"I love this product I have very dark circles and I use it around my eyes before my cover stick. It keeps the cover on my dark areas all day long."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Janet","Chicago, IL",3,"I love the Revlon face primer, so I thought I would love this too. But its hard to dispense - either you get too much or too little - and it doesn't blend well at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Dee1","Madison, TN",5,"I use before base &amp; eyeshadow."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","iheartmarshall","West Virginia",4,"I've been looking for an affordable highlighter when I came across this.  I know it's marketed mainly as an eye primer, but I use it to add a bit of life in the corners of my eyes and on my cheeks.  I just dab it on with the brush and then blend with my fingers and it looks great.  It's not shimmery or white like some powder highlighters I've tried and it gives my skin a perfect natural glow.  I don't have under eye circles nor do I use it as a primer, so I can't contribute in those areas but as an affordable highlighter, I definitely recommend this!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","n/a","kansas city, mo",4,"I will never go back to not using primer.  This stuff is quick to put on.  Your eyeshadow stays on all day and the primer makes it darker."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Make-up Fanatic","Miami, FL",5,"I really, really like this product. There are so many high end but really this one does the job and very well at that! I re-apply on the days that I am tired and need to look refreshed.  I definitely will continue to buy again and again."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Mom2Girls","Noblesville, IN",2,"It took an astounding number of turns before this product first dispensed.  I have very dark circles under my eyes that are hereditary.  This did not cover them at all.  I could see no difference between the eye I put it under and the other one.  I returned it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-primer-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4040057","Readaholic","Oak Park, MI",2,"I don't really like this product, I found that it did not brighten my eyes, nor did it help keep my eye shadow on. By the middle of the day it was creased."
