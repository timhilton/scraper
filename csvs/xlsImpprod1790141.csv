"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Maggie","Mars, pa",5,"I was recommended this product when the color stay powder looked too dark. Iim a medium but it looked lighter. I love it! It was a couple of bucks more to buy a fan brush. I love the outcome!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Jan","Marietta, Ga",5,"I like Revlon product, because they are economical, excellent products, and I heard a long time ago that they are not tested on animals.  I do not know if this is true."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Tessa","New York, CA",4,"I use this product and compare it to Sephoras matifying powder and MAC pressed powder and I have to say I really like this product. if you have oily skin or problem red spots it is perfect for your skin!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Audrey","Portland, OR",4,"I like this quite a bit, but it doesn't have much color to it. The regular ColorStay powder is better. Don't pay more for this PhotoReady one."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","sberrys","Mississippi",2,"Heard good stuff about this product so I figured I'd try it out. I did not like it. It felt gritty, like it had not been finely milled enough (ground), it didn't feel silky at all. Coverage was VERY minimal. I have combo skin, some areas are dry, others get oily, and others are normal. The areas I have that are dry felt like the Sahara desert the longer I had this product on my face. I could literally feel it pulling the moisture out of my face and couldn't stand it anymore and had to remove it. My dry areas are not even all that dry so I was pretty shocked that I needed to take it off. This would probably be a decent product for someone with very oily skin all over who only requires very sheer coverage but this was just not for me. Even if it wasn't drying I just couldn't get past the gritty texture. Very disappointed in this product, but giving it 2 stars for it's oil absorbing properties which are amazing."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","kk","New york",5,"I love this powder!! it covers so much and you could barely tell that your  wearing it! its not cakey and it doesnt crease!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Connie","Texas",5,"This powder gives you a finished look and helps to keep your base makeup from fading off."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Michelle","Orange,Ca",1,"Disappointed, and I am such a revlon lover!The powder is too thick, and gets blotchy. You can't reapply this powder throughout the day. It will get thicker and messy. Good for a slight light powder fix when first applying."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Jenna","Salt Lake City, UT",4,"Great for finishing a liquid foundation."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Madster the Make Up addict","Washinton",2,"This powder goes on very well but when I put it on with just concealer or just it alone it looks caked on and wipes of too easily."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Linda","Hamostead",5,"I use this everyday"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Irish girl!","Florida",5,"This powder covers well and blends easily.  No foundation needed!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Mermer","Cincinnati, Ohio",1,"The smell is extremely noticeable when applying this. It has a strong smell of dry wall or wet cardboard!!! I immediately smell it while applying it. <br />It also looks incredibly streaky and cakey. It doesn't blend well. My last foundation powder was a lot cheaper than this and it still worked better. It's really disappointing!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","CyndiT","Brandon, MS",4,"I keep this in my purse for touch ups throughout the day. Works great.  Only drawback is the brush that it comes with instead of a sponge. I use a sponge with this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Lynn","Orange County",5,"I used it years ago"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Shar","Atlanta, GA",2,"This powder didn't quite work well for me. I have overall normal skin but this powder seemed to make me shinier faster. I love the smonth feel of the powder but it doesn't last. Also no surprise, their lightest color is still not realistically light enough."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Ash","Boston, MA",5,"I love this! I think it covers nicely, it's buildable so it can look cakey if you pack it on just like with a lot of other powders. It doesn't feel heavy and it controls shine all day. I think it does a better job controlling shine than the Revlon Colorstay powder which is what I switched from. I'm not sure why some people are saying that there is glitter in it.... There is a little shimmer to it because the shimmer helps reflect light during pictures (hence the name photoready..) but you can only see a little shimmer in certain lights. I think it looks pretty since it doesn't make your face look dry and matte."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Keely","Charlotte, NC",5,"I was using BareMinerals, but when i lost my job I couldn't afford to keep up my expensive habits.  I tried the Photo Ready line.  I quickly realized that I could use the Photo Ready Powder without having to use the foundation to get the coverage I needed.  I use a flat makeup sponge to apply it.  It goes on smooth and covers all of my red rosecea covered cheeks.  My 13 yr old daughter is now using it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Mistydm320","Houston, TX",5,"I use this product daily and I love the coverage."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Lauren","Pleasant Prairie, WI",2,"I got this after needing a powder to set my foundation. I was told it was a good dupe for the Too Faced foundation powder. Oh, heck no. I have to pretty much scrub the powder with my brush to get it up, and doesn't cover very well. It's okay if you need something cheaper, but not really all that worth it. I do like that it has little bits of very, very fine gold micro-glitter in it to help illuminate your face though."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","KatD","Southwest, FL",5,"This powder is great. It is gentle, hasn't caused me Abby breakouts or skin issues. It lasts fairly well for drug store cosmetics and the light medium committee#20 is perfect. Very neutral, not top pink not too orange. I love it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Mom!","Mpls.,MN",5,"easy to use powder with great finishing results."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Renetta rosetta","Detroit, MI",2,"The brush that came with the product does not work well.  The packaging is difficult to open and the product does very little.  A waste of money."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","redavis","ky",5,"I'm VERY picky about my powder. I don't like heavy, cakey powders. This one is my fav. It's not heavy at all. I did notice some sparkle upon opening, but I do not notice any when it's on."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Irvy","Boise, ID",5,"I use this powder every day over my foundation and it's a winner. It's the perfect color for my ridiculously pale skin. I also really like how well it blends. Until I find something better - and I haven't yet - I'll stick with the Photo Ready.<br /><br />I should add that I have VERY sensitive, problematic skin, and this doesn't clog pores/cause breakouts/redden my skin. It's gentle and gives good coverage if I do have any blemishes."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Marble","Phoenix",1,"This is one of the worst powders I have EVER tried! It is so awful looking on the skin. If you have oily skin, larger pores, etc, STAY AWAY. Just so cakey and did absolutely nothing in terms of setting or keeping the greasy look at bay."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Ulta Lover","Cleveland, OH",2,"Wanted to try this product since I love Revlon. Applied this product and it looked okay in the house under bad lighting.. as I went outside and looked in my car mirror it looked as if cake was plastered on my face. Doesn't look natural and I used a small amount. Maybe a brush would of helped to apply instead of a sponge they give you."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Jenni Penni","Epsom, nh",5,"Love this as a makeup setter."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Musicgeek63","NY",4,"It has great coverage and it lasts a long time but it can get cakey at times. But other then that its a pretty good product. It also has a strange smell to it but I know it doesn't bother some people."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Tiff","Hanover,  Pa",5,"I use this everyday over my photo ready foundation and it adds a good finish to the look."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Dana Bug","Kennesaw",5,"I use this every day by using a large brush and dusting it all over my face after applying foundation. Helps it set and reduces shine. Also great for touch ups."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Caryl","Miami, Fl.",4,"This is the best powder I have found so far for my partly oily complexion that goes on without settling in fine lines and leaves a natural but more refined complexion. I would prefer better coverage however."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Blue Jean","Chicago, IL",2,"The brush was shedding on my face. I am using my own brush, but still I feel I keep puting on more to set my foundation. It is messy too, maybe a pad would be better then a brush?"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","tamarano07","Grand rapids, mi",5,"this is great! I am not one who usually wears foundation because it's always so unnatural looking, but this is so natural that I can hardly even tell I am wearing it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Suzanne the 40 something","El Paso, TX",5,"I like it because it is photoready and reasonably priced.  It does the job of a much more expensive product."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Zander","Michigan",3,"This is okay. I need a powder at the moment, but this one can be a bit heavy. It may be causing me to break out. And if you get dry skin, this certainly does not help."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Sways Mom","Aurora, IL",4,"I was never a big fan of face powder. When I started wearing foundation more I decided I needed something to finish the look decided to give this product a try. Before this product I had never gone through an entire tin of powder... I have finished and replaced this powder four times now and keep going back!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Yulia","St Cloud, MN",5,"I have been using powders for almost 9 years. So, basically, I have tried everything possible from very expensive to cheap ones. This powder is by far the best. It stays at least 6 hours even on my oily skin and covers acne very well."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Ro","Alabama",5,"Excellent!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","mslncdl19","Asheville, NC",2,"I loved the feel of this powder, but it tends to look cakey and cling to wrinkles. There is shimmer in this powder as well, so beware if you have large pores."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","meezer","Charlottesville, VA",2,"The powder is ok. It's light and good for controlling shine. The brush is horrible, though. The hairs come off all over your face."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Ellzie","Corpus Christi, TX",3,"This is really easy to apply and blends well, which is good, but it doesn't stay on for more than a few hours (and I don't touch my face any more than the next girl). It matches really well to your skin tone, it just doesn't stay on well."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","hadhoudy","new jersey",1,"I was having the highest hopes for this powder but the glitter is too much and in the harshest to the softest lights it looks cakey I probably should try it with primer but I use only tinted moisturizer or bb cream sometimes I have a quite perfected complexion but I like to experiment but ill probably use it for under eyes since they use translucent powder under the eyes and the glitter would probably look better respond if you have the same problem tell how it's like for you"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Ali","Kentucky",4,"I've tried a million different powders, and none go on as easily or set as well as the Revlon PhotoReady. It is a bit cakey, but for oily skin (like myself) it blends beautifully within 20 minutes."

If I use it with non-Revlon foundations, it cakes up."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","ellieA","Denver, CO",5,"I absolutely love this powder.  I have combination skin that changes with the weather.  My skin is sometimes oily, but then I also live in a very dry climate.  It is sometimes tricky trying to keep my skin from looking oily and prevent dry patches at the same time. I have tried so many brands, from drug store to department store brands.<br />I don't really have blemishes but it seems as I get older that my skin tone is uneven.  I like a decent amount of coverage without looking cakey.  I have a couple of different revlon foundations that I wear this with.  But I will also wear this on top of a light bb cream and even by itself.  It lasts all day, especially on top of foundation or my bb cream.  It's more matte and prevents the oily look especially when my skin is more oily."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Cassandra31","Bayside, Ca",3,"This product is great for the summer time mostly because its really sparkly... I would't wear this in the winter at all even thought it does look nice, if you get up close you can tell that there are sparkles on your face... Also if you are looking for some color in your powder the fair is basically a translucent powder so it has barely any color.  If you want a similar product for around the same price I would recommend Revlon's ColorStay Pressed powder. It is basically the same thing but with better coverage and no sparkles."

I get stopped by women that ask me what I use almost daily. I have oily skin so I use milk of magnesia as a primer to control oil, then apply liquid Photo Ready and Revlon Color Stay blemish correction, and then finish with Photo Ready powder. I have a friend that just switched to this routine, and she swears by it now too."

I have purchased Make up forever HD powder, prescriptives, Laura Mercier, Bare Minerals, Pur minerals, Sephora Brand, Benefit, MAC, L'Oreal true match and on and on and on.... I figured why not try Revlon? So I went to my local [...] and picked up this powder. The brush is a waste of plastic and silly. Buy a good powder foundation brush (I got mine at [...] Sonia kashuk $13) and apply your Revlon photo ready powder. On you bare skin (after a moisturizer is applied) the coverage is light and leaves your skin with a glow. You can also set your liquid foundation with this. I have oily/normal skin and some large pores and this minimized the pores well. I also am prone to breakouts and this powder left my skin very smooth and breakout free."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Taylor","Wilmington, NC",2,"The brush that comes with this is horrible. The powder itself is very thick, making it difficult to spread around the face. It's not really good as an overall powder. The look you get is more splotchy and even that doesn't last long."

That being said, I didn't really have much to &quot;set,&quot; other than the concealer. But I like to use a setting powder all over my face to give it a finished look, and set with a spray as well. This powder looked so beautiful when I first applied it- the micro-shimmers were so discreet, but perked up my skin just enough to look so beautiful! But within a couple hours, my skin felt so oily. This powder just didn't last very long on my face. To be fair, it doesn't claim to be long lasting, and I guess the compact makes it easy to throw in your purse for touch-ups. I just want to be done with makeup when I leave for the day. I don't want to be touching up all afternoon. But if I were to touch up, this does give a beautiful look!"

The brush that it comes with is cheap and leaves little bristles everywhere. Make sure that you use your own brushes."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Ski","Chicago",5,"This is fantastic stuff!  I have been using it for 2-3 years now, and really love it.  I use it alone over moisturizer.  It covers well, without being heavy, and looks very natural.  I used the light to medium shade in the winter, and the darkest shade in the summer.  It lasts all day.  It isn't cakey and the color blends well with my skin tone. (light to medium with yellow undertones)  I can't say enough good things about this product.  I really like that it isn't messy like some loose powders that are so popular and so expensive.  I apply this with a big powder brush.  Very nice and I think, good for people with sensitive skin."

All I have to do is put neutrogena under eye concealer underneath my eyes and if I have a couple of breakouts I put some concealer on there too. I apply the powder on and  it lasts all day and my skin looks fresh and flawless. I'v gotten complements on my skin looking clear and fresh and no one even asks if I wear foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","Loree124","Modesto, CA",5,"I purchased this on sale. I've used the same face powder for years but the sale price swayed me to try it. &quot;Photo&quot; in the name also caught my attention as we had a family photo shoot coming up.  I used it a couple of times before the shoot and was very happy with it.  I don't wear foundation, just concealer and a little cover up on problem spots.  The powder goes on nicely, I used a sponge, not the brush provided.  It didn't not crease around my eyes either.  On the day of our photos we were outside in the sun for approx 2 hours.  It was a long day and I did not touch up or even look in the mirror until we got home that night approx. 5 hours later.  I was amazed at the freshly applied look that I still had. I can honestly say that even though I had been out in the heat and dust of a rural location, I did not see the need to touch up.  It really did acheive the flawless look I was after.  The fact that it was long lasting was an added bonus.  I'm very happy with it and will look to add more of the photo ready items to my routine."

This powder did not impress me at all. The medium/light tone has an awful orange colour that looks terrible, no matter how little you put on, the end result is cakey and unnatural. The only pro to this product is that it seems to be long lasting, and provides average cover. Another thing, the accompanied brush is terrible. I don't think I would recommend this, although some of my friends love it (the ones who love to cake it on anyway)"

I tried two different shades, and it made my skin seem dull and washed out. The tiny, very small and flimsy brush that comes with this compact is terrible. Not worth the [$], should be priced much cheaper."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-powder?productId=xlsImpprod1790141","lazypile","Denver, CO",4,"I use this with the coordinating foundation, and I like them both a lot. If you have oily skin it might end up being a bit much. Also if you prefer a matte finish this powder isn't for you. It takes my shine away and replaces it with it with a &quot;glow.&quot;<br /><br />The brush for this is horrible, and not even worth trying to use. I use a soft kabuki brush, though I've also seen the suggestion of using a fan brush. Unfortunately this makes it not very portable, but I'm fine with that.<br /><br />If you want a use for the included brush (I hate to waste things), it does make a decent blush brush if you like flat blush brushes."

The only thing is I got the light/medium since I am an olive skin tone, and it turned out a little too dark, so I got the lighter one and it works great. I am very happy with this powder before this powder I was using nuetrogena powder/foundation, but this tops it by far!!!"

I have oily skin AND large pores and this is my new HG powder and I have tried everything...high end...low end..dupes you know it ! This is great...it doesn't take a whole lot to do the job..I use it sparingly and I apply with a soft powder brush..I don't care for the one included in packaging...I also buy this is a shade lighter than my normal wear as I tend to use finishing powder to tone down my bronzer addiction (I am notorious for bronzer getting the best of me) and this is great for correcting that !"
