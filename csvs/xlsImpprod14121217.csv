It has everything someone would want if starting out in makeup. The pigments are okay, definitely need a primer for the eyeshadow or else the color would flake off. <br /><br />Be careful when dipping brushes into the palette. I ended up with some eyeshadow and blush in the lipstick."

I was at the point where I was running out of almost everything and was about to start a new round of purchases (which add up quickly), when I saw Revlon's full face palette. If you're like me, most days you want to get out the door quickly, but spend too much time rooting around in a purse for separate products. I got the &quot;Romantic Nudes&quot; set which includes shades for a very natural and not overdone look. The eyeshadows are nice, with both shimmer and matte colors that never get too 'glittery'. I have mixed feelings about the blush, as I prefer a cream blush and it's not strongly pigmented. But if you use a heavier hand it leaves you with a soft peach glow with a touch of highlight (and is impossible to screw up). The lipsticks are a touch pink for my taste but they are sheer and flattering, and you can play around with the different glosses until you're happy. This may not work for you if you're the type that only feels comfortable in certain specific shades, but if you look good in most nudes this may make your life a little easier. It felt good to dump out a purse full of mostly-empty products and replace it with something simple! As a side note, remember that Revlon is one of the only major companies committed to not testing on animals!"

"http://www.ulta.com/eyes-cheeks-lips-palette?productId=xlsImpprod14121217","Amber","WV",4,"I got this as a gift.  And before I used it, I looked up some reviews on this site and on YouTube.  After some very poor reviews I was convinced I would hate it.  I went ahead and tried it for myself and was pleasantly surprised! This is a great little palette for travel and for a natural and easy makeup look for those days you want a hint of makeup without putting a lot of effort into it.  <br /><br />I have used this every day so far! I throw some BB cream on, use the eyeshadow, blush, and the lip color then top the look off with a coat of mascara and some highlighter and I'm ready to head outdoors or to the pool. <br /><br />This is not for those days you want to take your time with your makeup look or go glam.  But for the price, it's worth having for an easy and natural look for outdoors or the gym!"

It gives you much of what you need in a small compact unit. Revlon does make a nice product with a good color payout and somewhat long lasting staying power . In addition I like the color choices. Their is enough of a variety to give you a day to evening look"

First, I took a look at the tiny brushes that come with the palette: while I did not plan on using them anyway, I noticed that the bristles were falling out and they just looked really cheap. Then, I tried swatching the eyeshadows: the product does not pick up easily with a brush and very little remained on my skin, most of it just dusted off as I tried applying it with a brush. Maybe these could work if you use a good eyeshadow primer or a cream eyeshadow and then apply these on top, maybe. I even tried picking it up with my finger and it still was quite sheer and messy looking because it just won't blend. I didn't bother wearing the eyeshadows because I was so disappointed just by swatching them... Then I tried the blush: with a brush, very little came off. I could not see any product on my skin even if I tried several times to pick up a significant amount and apply with my finger; it's as if I didn't put on blush... and I have fair complexion. I don't think I've ever seen such a terrible blush. Finally, I was not at all impressed with the lip products; they reminded me a lot of those terrible makeup kits for children: same ugly colors and meh formula. And what a terrible terrible idea to put cream products right next to powder products... Stay far away from this palette. I'm pretty sure cheap makeup kits from Toys R Us can do better than this."

"http://www.ulta.com/eyes-cheeks-lips-palette?productId=xlsImpprod14121217","Robin","NW Ohio",5,"I picked the smokey pallet and the berry pallet.The berry pallet looks great on a dark hair,blue eyed gal, the smokey pallet I thought the color was dark grey,it is black,for me this makes a better eyeliner than eye shadow.I love that lips are included,this takes up very little space in my makeup collection as well as my purse/bag. I need something easy in a pinch,I am known as a &quot;hospital mom&quot;,my son is in and out so this is an easy grab without much thought or room. With the color choices you can go natural or dramatic.I wish I had found this last year when looking for a pallet for travel.I would buy again, thinking of getting the brown pallet when my pallet is gone."
