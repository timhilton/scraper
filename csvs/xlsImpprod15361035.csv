I saw it the first time while out shopping, and what drew my attention was that the packaging stated it was waterline-safe. I'm generally a liquid or gel liner wearer, but have been playing with bolder looks. I love the initial shape of this liner, but it dulls pretty quickly. It still gets the job done, but I'd love to be able to maintain its flat edge for thinner lines. This liner is so smooth it glides on like a gel. It's ultra-black and perfect for the waterline and tightlining. It's very soft, so I have to be careful not to use so much pressure it clumps in my lashes. On the flip side, its softness makes it great for smudging out, and the soft brush on the other end is great for blending it out."

This color looks good with just mascara. I love the angled pencil. It makes applying so much easier. I plan to get another color I like it so much."

No eyeliner stays in place (no transferring to beneath eyes whatsoever) like this one does. I received 3-4 compliments from diff co-workers first couple times I wore it. Makes eyes pop beautifully."

Feels like it doesn't irritate eyes as much as wax based products. I really like the fact that the brown color has a purplish tinge.  The smudge brush is super soft."

But this is even better because the eyeliner stays in place better than a shadow but I can still soften it with the brush. I originally just had this at work for when I didn't have time to do all of my makeup at home, but now I use it all the time. I have two colors and I'm buying a third one in my next Ulta order."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-2-in-1-angled-kajal-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod15361035","Dawn","Michigan",5,"This eyeliner is comparable in quality to benefits eyeliner and it's easier to remove. The angled tip allows for a precise line and the brush that's included is perfect for blending under the eye. Highly recommend!"
