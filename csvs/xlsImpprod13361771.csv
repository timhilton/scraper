"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Mascara girl","Raleigh, NC",1,"I feel like mascara is my number 1 product when doing my makeup, if my mascara is wrong, everything else feels off.<br />This mascara is very thick and dry when applying to lashes, so it doesn't allow for an even coat.  It also doesn't allow the lashes to separate evenly, and when using the brush to try and brush out and separate the lashes, it starts clumping.  One coat is all your lashes will take before it starts flaking and falling apart, and since it is a very dry mascara, it won't allow your lashes to curl long enough to stay in place, so you end up having lashes that droop into your eyes.  I have found cheaper and lower quality mascaras that work 10x better. Do not waste your money."

Loved it at first then I rubbed my eye one night and it broke my lashes off nearly to my eyelids! It does not do a thing to help lengthen your lashes and I found the brush to big to get to my bottom lashes."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Alise","Perrysburg",2,"I personally just don't like it.  It doesn't cover my lashes well I have to apply multiple times. Also it doesn't lengthen at all.  I would on buy again if I had no other options. The brush seemed nice...maybe it would work well with a different product. I guess u get what u pay for. N"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","CharlieW","Michigan",5,"I have this in both the brown and black. The brush is wonderful for volume or length. My lashes don't turn out clumpy and I don't get flakes throughout the day. Most importantly, it does not harden my lashes. They are still soft to the touch. A quality of a much more expensive mascara."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","fab303","Columbia",5,"This mascara is wonderful! It grips the lashes in such a wonderful way to give you length, and volume. I highly recommend it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Shelby","alabama",5,"I don't understand why people don't like this product It does everything it says and more! Yes, there are others on the market that do the same thing, but for the price, this is an everyday necessity."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Bailey","Mckinney",4,"I use this product after applying my favorite mascara. It helps add length and to separate lashes so that they aren't too clumpy."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Mommy jess","Woodhaven",5,"I am very picky about mascara, I do not like thick brushes because they tend to clump the product on too thick. This product however did not and I love it."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Yayi","Chicago,il",4,"It was pretty good with 2 or 3 coats"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","dbell","Illinois",2,"When I bought this mascara I was very excited to try it, but was then disappointed after a couple weeks of wearing it. The mascara gives your lashes good enough volume for day to day wear, but I like having more when going out. I have also found that it flakes off pretty easily after a day of wearing it."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","ssawyeraz","Phoenix, AZ",5,"I'm in love with this mascara. I was previously using Revlon's Black Lacquer mascara which I liked but wanted to try something different. This mascara is the only one I'll use now. It creates great volume and length, don't clump, has a great brush, is easy to remove, and doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes. Best of all, it feels so lightweight that I can't tell I'm wearing it. I also love the handle, I don't feel like I'm going to drop it all the time like a round handled mascara wand. I recommend one coat for day-to-day wear and two coats for evening. One coat is enough to give awesome volume but the second just really makes my lashes wow! This product makes my natural lashes look like falsies."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Ashley","Ny",3,"Better than other Revlon mascaras I've tried but not my favorite."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","LashLover","LA",5,"This was the first mascara I have ever bought for myself. I had just picked it up at the drugstore and when I got home and applied it, I was thrilled! It did everything you would expect a good mascara to do, even though the brush looks kind of lame. I didn't realize its greatness, so I had decided to invest in higher end mascaras, but I found that many of them didn't apply as evenly as this one, or came off easily enough. I just keep coming back to this mascara. Love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Tris D","Houston, TX",3,"Tried it on a whim and love the customized idea for specific different types of mascaras. Best for just a natural look. VERY easy to apply, you don't have to worry about clumping or smudging while applying. The color isn't extremely pigmented and it doesn't necessarily make your eyes &quot;pop&quot;. The tube I had did dry out after just 4-5 weeks of usage."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","PRR","Casselberry FL",4,"I purchased this one when there was a Revlon special and I've enjoyed the product. Really like the thickness of the brush when it's applying mascara onto my lashes Have not had any issues with clumps or smudging during the day either. I'd buy it again."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Karen","Sydney",1,"Don't do anything.  waste of $. all it did was make me look I had sparse lashes which is not true. Clumps together and makes it look one single lash."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","wdl","Wetumka, OK",5,"I use it daily.  It seems to last most of the day.  Doesn't smudge."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361771","Lanie","Birmingham",4,"I bought this product and the Revlon All-in-One mascara at the same time, and the All-in-One was and utter disappointment. In comparison, this mascara does what a mascara should do. It lengthens and fans out the lashes and makes them look fuller. All in all, a great product."

By the end of the night, it looked like I had short lashes with no mascara ???? Never happens with Loreal's Butterfly or Manga. I will stick with those from now on."
