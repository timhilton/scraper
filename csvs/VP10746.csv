"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Ellie","Long Beach, CA",2,"I wear a substantial amount of makeup everyday. The whole shebang. I tried the sister eyeliner with the SKINNY applicator which I was actually looking for in store but it was out of stock, so I decided to go with this. I don't know why but I feel like the formula is different. This one isn't as pigmented as I would like, putting it over my eyeshadow is a two layer job and even then it looks watered down. It also bleeds so I ended up with larger wings than anticipated, when I finally got a perfect line I looked like I was going for an Amy Winehouse impersonation. Luckily my style is crazy so it works, but for a simple line for daily wear, I would not recommend this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Moe","Greeley CO",5,"Love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Amy","LA, CA",5,"This is my go to eyeliner when I can't afford to shell out the big bucks for &quot;designer&quot; eyeliner. I have probably been using it for the past 10 years. Very easy to use and doesn't fade. Highly recommended for anyone looking for good quality for a reasonable price."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Chris","Missouri",4,"Love this for a thin line to define the eyeline. As it's got a skinny applicator, adding a thinker line takes practice to avoid smudging or uneven line"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Ash","Il",5,"Perfect lines, easy application. Doesn't smudge and stays on. Perfect cat eyes everytime. I have been looking for a new liquid liner but have not found a new one to replace the one I loved that they discontinued, until now!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Dani","Littleton, CO",5,"I use this eyeliner for winged and cat eyes. I've used various liquid eyeliner including brands such and urban decay and tarte. I love tarte. It's my favorite make up line but none of these brands compare to this eyeliner. I use this eyeliner every day and it usually lasts me about 2 months which isn't bad. The best thing about it in my opinion is the applicator. I do not like the loose brush liquid liners. This one is like a little beauty blender sponge. It's amazing and it seriously is the best for winged liner. If your go to look is winged or cat liner this is the liner for you!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Tbanks1012","La Crosse, WI",4,"This product has a very self explanatory application process. Just be sure to wipe off or dab off excess liquid before application to avoid uneven lines"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Gingerkitten","Fort Wayne, IN",5,"The felt tip is the best feature. It's flexible so you can get exactly the right angle you want! I've been using this liquid eyeliner for years. It's never disappointed me. And the best part is that it's cheap!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Lindy","Henderson, NV",1,"Its hard to apply additional coats to make it darker because it seems watery."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Neenerlopez","Oregon",5,"Goes on easy!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","trendy gal","Carlsbad CA",4,"I liked this a lot i have tried to use other brands and I absolutely hate them they're not bold enough and they run."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Sall2032","Nashville, TN",4,"This eyeliner has a more stiff brush than I am used to, but overall it goes on pretty easily and stays there all day. It comes off easily and looks pretty good on. :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Photojen","San Jose,CA",5,"The revlon liner works great! You get nice even bold color and super easy to apply a thin or thick line. I've tried tons of liquid liners and this is by far the best!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Kelly","Exton, PA",2,"I LOVE liquid eyeliner.  It is the only thing that I use.  However, this is very difficult to put on because the brush is hard.  It is much easier to use a soft brush."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Girly Girl","Atlanta, GA",5,"I've tried several different brands of liquid eyeliner and this one by Revlon Colorstay really is the best one out there!  It gives the eyes great definition and really makes them POP!  Easy to apply, stays on perfectly all day yet easy to remove with eye make up remover or even soap and water.  LOVE IT :)<br /><br />Great tip if you're not use to applying liquid eyeliner...first, use a black eye pencil to line the tops of lash line, then starting with the inside corner of the eye, slowly start dabbing the liquid  applicator slowly across the line until you reach the outer corner of eye.  Do one eye first and apply your mascara.  Notice how the eye really pops compared to the other eye!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Sandra","Illinois",4,"Stays on as long as you don't rub or touch your eye."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Jenny from the block","Pleasanton, CA",5,"I've used MAC bootblack. Although this product is not as bold and dark as bootblack, I was very impressed with the results. Its a quality product at affordable rate. It defines eyes perfectly. It lasts long and does not smudge or run in eyes."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Tulips","Boston",3,"Just ok. Need better color pigmentation."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Melly","Los Angeles, CA",3,"I've tried eyeliner pencils without luck since they all seem to run down to my lower eyelid throughout the day, so I decided to try a liquid eyeliner. I was excited about this one because of all the hype and amazing ratings, but soon I found out that I wasn't too fond of it. The product does give you the ability to make an amazing fine line, however, the product creases a lot, perhaps it is due to my eyelid but I had to reapply the product at least 5 times and that is just too much of a hassle for me. I only keep it around to create the fine lines at the the ends of my eyelids after I apply my main gel eyeliner. The product does come in a nice container, the color is dark, but I did have to put a couple layers on to get it dark enough to my liking. And a couple minutes later or so, I'd have a crease and have to reapply again."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Make-up Babee!","Midland, TX",5,"So far (have been using a week now) this product is working great. Goes on smoothly, stays all day. No problems or cons."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","DawnMarie","Fallbrook, CA",5,"I have used other liners, but this is my favorite and it is simple to use. It is also quick to use and accurate for either a thin or a thick line."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Terri","Brentwood, TN",5,"I have been searching and searching for an eyeliner that won't smear and I finally found it. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this eyeliner. I apply it in the morning and wear it all day and it never smears, I have finally found the one :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Light Hearted","Columbus, OH",5,"An alternative to the customary black liner."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Nicole","Phoenix, Arizona",5,"Winged eyes are my every day look, and I've gone through so many different brands and types of eyeliners. I've purchased both cheap and expensive, as well as pencils, gels, and liquids. I've used different sized applicators ranging from tiny, wispy brushes to super thick felt tips, and dealt with terrible pigmentation and durability issues. I can honestly say that Revlon's Colorstay Liquid Liner is the best of all categories when trying to create the most perfect wing! I typically don't apply liquid liner on my water line so I would only recommend using on the lid. I can apply this early in the morning, spend an entire day at work, and my liner lasts until I take it off at night. It loses very slight pigmentation, but not enough to need complete reapplication before heading back out for the night! One of the few downsides to the durability is that, if you make any mistakes when applying, you'll need makeup remover to correct. My skin type is normal/dry, and I've had minor irritation on the outer corner of my eye while the product is drying (I typically have that problem with most makeup, though.) The formula is fairly wet to begin with, so I may not recommend to beginners, and a little goes a long way. I've consistently repurchased this product and will continue to do so!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Allies Mom","Greeley, co",4,"Easy to apply and lasts all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Light Hearted","Columbus, OH",5,"I don't wear a lot of any type of makeup but this eyeliner defines your eyes and helps you to not look tired!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","instagram_rockymua","Paso Robles, CA",1,"I am a liquid liner pro, and I found this one difficult to apply because it was so liquidy. As you run the liner along the lid, it begins to seep into creases. Also, it never dries. You can bet this liner will be at the top of your eye socket at the end of the day."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Adri","Maryland",5,"This is my very first liquid eyeliner and it does take practice to perfect the way you apply it. <br />It lasts all day and will not move unless you wipe it clean with a makeup remover!<br /><br />The only dislike i have is that its a very wet formula and the packaging is like an inkwell. So be careful when taking it out if you are clumsy like me."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","jackiebuns","Chicago, IL",1,"After an hour or two, it smudged like crazy. I don't know about you girls but that'll make it or break it for me. Will be returning."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","M4rsy","New Braunfels",1,"I dislike this product! It burned my eyes all day! when I washed it off, I felt a relief. I would not recommend this product to anyone! I have never experienced this with an eyeliner! Not only were my eyes itchy, they turned all red! like if I had really bad allergies!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","JMP","Tulsa, OK",4,"I use it everyday to enhance my eyes.  Love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","VICTORIANCOLLEEN","TEMPERANCE, MI",5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRAND &amp; COLOR FOR YEARS, I EVEN HAVE MY DAUGHTERS &amp; TWIN SISTER USING IT, NO COMPLAINTS"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Tessajd02","Austin, TX",5,"Perfect liquid liner.  Easily can adjust the thickness of the line you draw.  Stays on.  Glides on easily."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Brittkitten","Sacramento, CA",5,"The color payoff for the black is very defined and bold. You can achieve thin lines easily with the brush that comes with it, but also get good thick lines by simply retracing over the thinner lines until you receive the thickness you want.<br /><br />The liquid doesn't smudge or run when applying and it has a clean matte black finish. It's relatively thin in consistency, so it doesn't clump or look clumpy. It's a perfect cheaper alternative and comparable to high end or professional liquid eyeliners."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Karen","Cottage Grove, MN",5,"I am a Revlon fan so just about any one of their products I will buy."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Latha","Irving, TX",5,"The liquid is dark and smooth.  However the tip of the brush looses thickens before the product is finished.<br /><br />I use this product every single day."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Angie","Las Vegas. NV",4,"I love how easily this product is to apply.  Plus, it washes off easily."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Lolo","Santa Rosa, CA",4,"I love using this product, and it is relatively easy to apply thanks to the shape of the application tip. Towards the end of the day my eyelids do become a little oily which smudges the liner a bit, but overall I recommend this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","ddarline","Escondido, CA",5,"The best liquid eyeliner I have used so far that does what it says it will do: long lasting, won't smudge, fade or smear (however if you press too hard it will run a bit -- newbie mistake on my part). Don't buy those cheaper eyeliners that say they will do the same thing because they will either dry up really fast or not provide a dark line.  Get this one; it's the most bang for your buck!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","MiSsyNude","Sacramento, ca",5,"I love this eyeliner and prefer it over any other eyeliner. It is easy to use because of the applicator tip and the color is so bold."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Golden Girl","New York",5,"Wonderful eyeliner with a precise application.  Much better than the expensive brands I've tried.  I would not start a day without it."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Charli","Lake in the Hills, IL",5,"I LOVE this product. I used to shy away form liquid eyeliners because I assumed them to be a runny mess. This product is crazy awesome! It not only looked great but it helped me to improve my &quot;cat's eye&quot; look. No matter what occastion I'm putting make-up on for I use it to add that extra pop."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Dizgirl","Alabama",2,"While the applicator feels very natural in hand I had a hard time using it trying to achieve a smooth line"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Quitabandita","Los Angeles",5,"I have had this for at least 4 years and it has yet to dry up or run out, and I use it quite a lot. I find the applicator very easy to use, it goes on smoothly and perfectly every time. As for staying power - I wore this for almost 48 hours during Mardis Grais, and it stayed looking perfect through parades, dancing, drinking, sleeping, and then washed off easily with some soap &amp; water. The only downside to this is I wish it came in more colors, I would be so excited if they made it in navy or purple."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Krissy","Cincinnati, Ohio",5,"I am new to liquid liner and this has been so easy to use. I tried a covergirl product first and it dried out after the first use. This goes on easy and dries quickly. Perfect for creating a flawless cateye."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Rita","Gainesville, FL",1,"I looked like a raccoon after a few hours of wearing it &amp; I did not like that!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Quick Face Vic","Miramar FL",5,"I use this product during the week went I need to edge up my look;the applicator makes it great to apply...I felt a lil burn but after a few uses, it was good to go !! Hopefully it still be available when I am done with this one...repeat buy for sure.<br /><br />Wish there were more vibrant colors and not dark versions of purple, navy blue - where are the gold, teal, fushia??"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","velvetjones","minneapolis",3,"ok."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Jojo","Houstone, TX",5,"I really like this liquid eyeliner. My previous one was almost invisible. I would definitely recommend this. :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Geobabe1874","Tucson",5,"I am a mary kay girl, but this is the ONLY eyeliner I use! I started using this in high school  8 yrs ago when I needed my color guard makeup to stay all day through double competitions and practice before and between and it is now a life saver for sorority recruitment. Can do thin or thick lines. Very easy to control, last all day, never have to touch up, even through crying, but easily comes off with remover. versitile for day and evening looks. I dont have one bad thing to say about this product!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Chickadee","NJ",3,"I bought this eyeliner because of a BOGO 50% off deal.  I didn't really need it, but I knew that I would use it.  I don't use the applicator as it is, I use a MAC 209 eyeliner brush because I can control how much product is on the brush and it's more flexible.  I have used the type of applicator that it comes with though, and it's not bad, just not ideal for me.  I felt that this got a little bit smudgy over the course of the day and the line did not look as sharp over time.  But overall, it's a good cheap eyeliner.  I'm not sure I would repurchase, I have to use it more first before I decide."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","laura","Illinois",5,"I love it"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Chrisi","Tennessee",1,"This eye liner should not be called Blackest Black because it is practically a muddy clear liquid. Maybe the one I got in my order was expired, but I'm NOT willing to repurchase it and give it another try."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","golfcat","Jacksonville, FL",5,"I've used this product daily for several years.  Have tried a couple of other types, but none have the quality of this one.  And it's easy to get a nice thin line."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","worthless","Texas",2,"Well you draw the line and you need to draw another line the previous line gets smeared allover the and so there for you don't get a nice cat liquid eyeliner"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Beth T","Prescott Valley, Arizona",5,"Bought this product for my sister... she doesn't wear much makeup - this works very well for her"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","AJ","Minneapolis, MN",5,"This is my go to liner.  the felt style brush tip gives you complete control and is perfect for trying out different styles of lining your eyes."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","PenguinHill","Illinois",5,"High quality liquid eyeliner.  Black-brown is a nice option for days that you want the clean line of a liquid liner but black is too intense."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","PenguinHill","Illinois",5,"This is my go-to liquid eyeliner.  It doesn't run or fade, goes on smoothly, and because it is densely pigmented, you only need a small amount and it lasts forever.  I have poorer quality liquid liners from other brands that are thin/watery, and I will often use this as a base layer before the others and it still doesn't run.  My ONLY complaint is that Revlon used to make this in a shade that was black with a small amount of shimmer - it was lovely and I wish they would bring it back!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Lindar","Vineland, NJ",4,"It is a good product, but you must wait a while for it to dry. If not it will smudge if touched. It takes a while to dry. It is easy to apply and easy to take off with makeup remover."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Jen71","New York, NY",5,"I wore this eyeliner the other day and it went on so smoothly and created a beautiful bold look!  This is definitely going to be my everyday liner"

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Cam","Los Angeles",5,"This is a great product! It was recommended to me by a friend years ago and I have repurchased it time and time again. It is easy to apply, glides right on! The brush tip allows for a smooth thin or thick line application."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Hearts Makeup","San Francisco, CA",5,"I use this practically everyday (or every time I want to add some umph to my eyes). I can easily create both thin and thick lines with its applicator. My 'con' about it being difficult to remove may come from the fact that it's not meant to budge, but nothing some eye make-up remover can't help with :)<br /><br />Good stuff."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Jenny from the block","CA",5,"its a great product for the money!!!!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","FutureExMrsMalcolm","Los Angeles",5,"I do winged eyeliner most days, and this is the stuff to use.<br /><br />It's more convenient in the mornings than a brush and gel eyeliner, dries smooth and matte unlike some liquid eyeliners that dry shiny and flake off, and the applicator tip is easy to use. Recommended this to a friend who only uses expensive dept store cosmetics and she's a convert now.<br /><br />Each tube lasts for-ever, and the tip maintains its shape well. <br /><br />I heard a rumor that this was getting discontinued a few years ago and I seriously stocked up like it was Armageddon... Glad to see its still around and I'll keep using it religiously!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Nessa B","Sterling, VA",4,"This is only my second time trying a liquid eyeliner, but I'm very pleased.  It's a little difficult to get on in one smooth line, but I'm hoping after some more practice I'll get the hang of it.  It lasts all day.  Overall, I'm very happy with the product."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Jess the Makeup Addict","Boston Ma",3,"Great formula which glides on. I dont like the brush as it is a little too bulky. If i do a little wing out, the wing fades or completly is gone by the tume i come home from school. I havnt tried it with a priner though"

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Someone","NJ",4,"While I'm sure there's a better liquid eyeliner out there. This is the best one for the price! I've tried all the comparable brands. Whether I'm doing a thin line above my lids during the day or a thicker line for going out this does the trick and lasts all day for me. I line my top lids w a regular pencil first so I have a line to follow then glide over with this. Perfect every time and I am super meticulous about my eye makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Bekki","Pontiac MI",5,"Favorite liquid liner. I can create thin to thick lines. love it"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Hannah","Seattle, WA",5,"This has been my go-to eyeliner for years. I've recently started testing the waters with felt tip liners, but when I'm in a rush or just going bare face with a cat eye, this is always my go-to, Great color payoff, super easy to apply, and so smooth. The only thing is the brush does eventually start to wear out, but for the price and how often I use it, it's worth the re-purchase."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Hollywood","Pocatello Idaho",5,"I love bold eyeliner everyday of my life and this is the best option that I have found"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Sarah","Cincinnati, OH",3,"This product did what I wanted I just needed to let it dry longer than most liquid liners before even blinking. It was very wet coming out of the container....so just give yourself extra time before doing anything to let it set longer than your typical liquid liner. Other than that it was easy to use and lasted all day!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Stacy","Oceanside, CA",5,"Formula is excellent hardly ever smudges, unless you cry. It's not water proof but it last all day. Very black, which I love! If you're looking for a new eyeliner definitely go with revlon!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","K.Pierce","Chandler, AZ",5,"This eyeliner goes on smooth and easy to remove if you're taking your makeup off or if you make a mistake. Thin lines as well as thick lines are easy to apply."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","CR","Orlando",5,"As soon I discovered this product a few years ago I never bought another eyeliner. I have used the thinner version as well but I have large round eyes so I prefer this size. It lasts all day. It may fade a TINY bit in the corners but for an everyday long lasting cat eye this eyeliner is perfect."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Haley","Pittsburgh, PA",5,"I've been using this eyeliner forever and won't ever switch. Never clumpy or dries out. Goes on so smoothly and has the perfect tip. Not thin or flimsy, sturdy and gives you the perfect line!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Emma","USA",5,"The idea of this liquid eyeliner is fantastic: having the liquid not come out of the top (applicator), instead it is dipped into a small, black tube. This product is very true to color and word (meaning what it claims). Bonus: It can stand upright on a table. I find the it is best for thick, but non-winged eyeliner. It's not very good for wings because the tip is stiff (but that's what I like). I only use it on and above my lash-line (Why would someone put a pointy stick covered in black liquid in his/her eye?)."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Mema","Corvallis Oregon",4,"Love its color, it's so matte black.<br />I hate it doesn't remove by washing it, I have to wipe few times to get rid of it.<br />And I feel it's a little dry(there's not much liquid inside?!)"

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Adriana","Chicago, IL",4,"This is a really great eyeliner that lasted all day and night for me. I wore it twice since purchasing it, and I was really surprised at how easy it was to apply, and how perfect it ended up looking. With other liquid eyeliners, I always had the problem that one side wouldn't match the other, whether one line was thicker than the other, or the &quot;wings&quot; didn't match. When I used this eyeliner for the first time, it literally felt like I had the accuracy of a permanent marker. I'd never used an eyeliner quite like it before. It was super easy to make a very thin line for a casual day running around, and then make it thicker and more defined for a night out. The only downside I did notice (and this may be beause I tend to have senstive skin on my face and have had an allergic reaction to a mascara before) was that I felt a slight burning sensation when I first put it on. Now I don't wear liquid eyeliner every day (although I used to for years up until about last year), but this one made me feel like I needed to scratch the area slightly. This only lasted until the eyeliner dried,and then I was good to go. So not a reaction that would prevent me from purchasing again, but just thought I would share in case anyone else tends to be sentitive to certain eye products."

You have to shake the product really well, though, before applying; otherwise, the application will be too dry and will tug on your skin &amp; sting slightly.

Perhaps my expectations are more geared toward a 'gel' look, but I was in no way prepared for the 'felt tip marker' look of this liner. After applying my MAC paint pots and eyeshadow, I carefully applied a coat of the Colorstay eyeliner and was appalled; it really looked very cheap.  I'm searching the internet to see if I can 'save' this purchase by mixing it with something to give it more of a gloss look, anything to help. Some might like the EXTREMELY matte look--I do not."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Supa_Kris","Okinawa, Japan",5,"I've been using this type of liner for 5 years now. It's worked nicely for me all this time. It's not for smokey eyes if you are just going to use liner and thats it. If you intend to soften the line with black eyeshadow or something then, its an awesome base line to follow! It's a very precise and distinct looking liner.  If you don't have a steady hand, I wouldn't suggest it for you. If you are a beginner, however, it may be a good start, though... The applicator is a little stiff, it softens over regular use, which can cause a little more difficulty when trying to wing out the ends of your eyes..But still a wonderful, easy way to decide how thin or thick you want your liner to be. Very defined..If you have trouble with your line, the tip of the applicator is defined enough to actually patch a line in, (dot to fill in a line that is not always straight by the lashes) works great! It's a little difficult to take off if you make a mistake. So try to get it right the first time. (I use a baby wipe to fix my boo boo spots, if needed!) Which in turn is a good thing, because it doesn't budge, smudge or move all day! Even after a workout! Shower, or rain is a different story.. and by rain, I mean pouring rain.. But once it starts to run, its easy to remove. (wipe under eyes in the rain.) Doesn't lose its line though! Great Eyeliner.. I can't really complain, I will be a fan for a lifetime! OH! Annndddd!

I normally wear Palladio liquid eyeliner, but I found this one to be very comparable.  I like the applicator or point.  It makes it easy to apply and reminds me of the Palladio eyeliner.  The color is good and rich."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Bre","Saginaw, MI",3,"This is a pretty bold, sturdy liquid eyeliner. It does still smudge unto my water line though. Another thing is that you cannot go over the same line twice (at least not at once) or the previous color will wipe off. You would have to wait for it to dry to re-draw."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","natural","Greensboro, NC",3,"This was my first liquid eyeliner so I had a tough time putting it on well. I also had to wait a while for the liquid to dry so that it wouldn't get on my eyelids when I open my eyes."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","A","Riverside",2,"It is good because it goes on easily and glides smoothly making it easy to shape your liner how you want. The bad thing is that it smudges throughout the day and it's not easy to remove once it's already smudged. But if you beat it before it smudges, it is an easy removal."

This eyeliner is more &quot;marker-like&quot; than liquid..and a dried up marker at that.

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Katie","Allen, TX",2,"I like a very thin brush for applying eyeliner.  This one was not good for me. You need very steady hands to draw a precise line.  Only applied one time and eyeliner tip was way too wide for my liking."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Beauty Cautious","Dallas, Tx",4,"Its great! The only problem is that if you don't let it dry, it will make a crease on your upper eye lid. But other than that it's fantastic!"

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Rebecca Ivy","Miami, fl",5,"I have this liquid eyeliner in brown and black, I love it. It has a thicker handle than most liquid eyeliners and the eyeliner part is stiff enough that you have good control when drawing the eyeliner,"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","EMRogers","Dallas, TX",5,"I use this liner everyday. I can go thin or thick for evening wear. It last a long time and does smudge eventually after like 8-9 hrs naturally with the oil of your skin. I also like that it doesn't have the wet look after it dries. So I would definitely recommend. Oh and it's easy to put on as well. :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Laura","Boston MA",4,"I like this liquid eyeliner because it is a true black.  The applicator holds just the right amount so that it's not too much black liquid, but just enough."

It is my FAVORITE LINER. (I use smashbox mascara, urban decay eyeshadow and pencil liner, anastasia eyebrow pencil otherwise.) They were out of the &quot;skinny&quot; and only had this product. To my disappointment, after only a bit more than a week- when I went to apply this to my eyes, the black liner went on unevenly. I had to keep applying this liner to my lids so that the black was uniform. Get the &quot;skinny&quot; one. You can play around with it and make it as thick or thin as you want. Obviously the only reason I had stuck with Revlon after using other brands is because the liquid &quot;skinny&quot; liner is good. Just don't buy this one!"

It is good for those who like a thicker line with their liner. Drys quickly and has a deep color pigment. I have dark brown skin so I'm always searching for a liner that will be black enough for a dramatic contrast and this does the job well."

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Nicole","Syracuse, NY",5,"I use this product every day for about 7 years. I find it easy to use with the narrow felt tip to make perfect lines. Plus the color is very rich which means I don't have to keep going over my eye lid to get it to produce the effect I want.  I like that the eye liner is more matte than most other liquid liners. I do not like shiny/metalic eye liner. I have also used this product for halloween makeup to make details on skin."

I've only used this product for years and I have never changed it. Long lasting, easy to take off with makeup remover, and is long lasting. The felt tip is easier for me to wing my eyeliner better than felt pens in my opinion. Perfect precision. Just all around favorite!"
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Issa","Webster tx",5,"Like it , and I also like the marker they are both good for the cat eye look"

"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Maggie","Los Angeles, CA",4,"I've tried other drugstore brand liquid eyeliners, and so far this is my favorite. It's easy to apply, whether you want a thin or thicker line, and it goes on smoothly and defined. It lasts through my 8 hour workday, fading and smudging only slightly. My favorite thing about it is that it is a highly pigmented, bold black!"

It's hard to find many liquids anymore with a felt tip applicator, but the felt tip honestly works better for me than most brush applicators.  And being able to acheive a perfect cat eye in about 20 seconds makes this product even better.  It's perfect for wearing to work, going out, or even casual day makeup, especially if you're going for a more classic look. And it does not budge, even if you accidentally sleep with it on!"

It's terrific if you need a great all day wear liner. It's super easy to apply. The angle, and pressure that you hold it at when applied, is what determines the heaviness of the line you want. I didn't have to worry about smearing or flaking, and it lasts."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","LilEmScores","Iowa",5,"This is the best liquid eyeliner I have used! Lasts longer than my cover girl or maybelline soft eye liners and gives a winged look easier. It is. A pointy, small felt tip on the lid that screws into the liquid, which is perfect! You can go thin, hick, bold, natural- endless possibilities! Great choice."
"http://www.ulta.com/liquid-eyeliner?productId=VP10746","Helen","Aurora, CO",5,"This is one of my favorites. It doesn't smudge or run and the lines are sharp. I am not perfect at eye lining but this one makes it so easy for me. Love it."
