"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","kcherer","Billings, MT",5,"I'm not sure if this product behaves differently in humidity, but for me creasing is not an issue.  You simply apply a light layer of eye shadow over the cr&egrave;me and you've got color that lasts all day long. I especially love nudes or naturals because you can pair them with some sparkle without getting shiny dust all over the place.  I never use just powders now, this is always on underneath"

I got palette Seashells, and these colors are beautiful! However, I cannot wear them: they crease in less than an hour! Used it on a bear eyelid - creases, used it on a powdered eyelid - creases,used it on top of Urban Decay eye primer - still creases, huh! What a shame, Revlon! You created a low quality product and it is still on shelves in stores....<br />Will never buy it again."

It applies really easily, you can just dip your finger in the product and apply.  This particular color combination is impossible to screw up and looks wonderful on my eyes either toned up, with mascara and full face, or barebones with just a tinted moisturizer and lip balm."

Some reviewers have indicated they crease, however, I apply them over my Urban Decay shadow primer and don't have that problem at all.  You can make the color as natural or intense and you like with nothing but your finger tip.  Great for travel, throwing in your purse on the go, or any day of the week."

"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","Princess","Houston, TX",1,"I hate this creme shadow. It was hard to apply and it did not hold my color. I used this as a base for my eyeshadows of course and my shadows creased faster than they would have if I had not used any at all. I would not recommend this to anyone."
"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","KatieDear","Jackson, TN",3,"I purchased this in the Wild Orchids hues.  It applies easily, it's affordable, but I feel like the colors that won me over in the store aren't the colors that come through in application.  It's odd...three of the four colors look almost identical on my lids.  I will finish this up but probably would not purchase again."

Amp up the look by adding the darker colors in the crease, outer corners, and for lining. Blends well when first applied, then stays well once it dries. I will check out other colors and buy again."

"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","christinelizabeth","st.louis, mo.",5,"I think the questions asked are for hair color, as I am reviewing eyeshadow, but it is a great product. A creme shadow, with lots of different fun and funky colors. For the extreme trndsetter, or the Au Naturale, you will find a color for you. I use 2 different color pallettes, daytime and nighttime, and i have to buy the daytime monthly, as it doesn't go far, but it is SO worth it. Also works best with an angled eye shadow brush. DO NOT use a sponge type aplicator, or all it will do is stay in the sponge, and the angled brush works excellent with this product. Goes on really smooth and simple, and easy to color blend."
"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","Lemonpuff","Destin, Florida",3,"I tried the &quot;Twilight&quot; color palette; very blueish, just OK, a bit too sparkley for my 51 year old eyes but it's fun to wear out on a special date.  I found I had to reapply/touch up after just a few hours even with a primer.  Just OK, nothing special."

I have NOTHING good to say about this product. The colors seem pretty before opening the compact, but when you do open it, the colors aren't as expected and are terrible! When I put the shadow on, it was really sticky and messy! Not easy to apply. I would not recommend this product. I immediately threw it away."

"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","HeartofGold","Macomb, OK",5,"I use these individually as a complete base coat on my lids as an undercoat, then apply my everyday colors.  The creme eyeshadow is like the foundation that holds all the other make up in place without creasing and sparkles thru adding depth to my overall look.  When I'm in a hurry, I just use one color from lid to brow with a simple liner and mascara.  So easy and looks so good."

The colors are great, you get lots of product, and it's highly pigmented.

As someone with greasy lids, I haven't gone near anything creamy for my eyes in over a decade. However, since the colors searched so beautifully, I gave it a try. <br />On its own, the shadow lasted less than an hour. <br />With primer and setting powder, I got about 3 hours before it disappeared into my creases. <br />I had better luck using this with my regular shadows...using it to highlight inner corners or only using it as a base. <br /><br />Overall, this isn't something I would recommend as for the price, there are far more superior eyeshadows at Ulta."

I was planning on buying Not Just Nudes but I ended up buying Skin Lights because it caught my eye. Skin Lights seemed prettier but after being so pleased with it, I'm probably gonna buy Not Just Nudes next! It's a reasonable price and the packaging is cool. There's a mirror inside too. Too much shimmer has always been a peeve to me when it comes to eyeshadows but these shadows are spot on. There's shimmer, but not too much so it looks natural. Just use a clean finger to apply then you're good to go! These can be used alone or with other powder shadows."

These are perfect because even though some of the colors look intense at first, one or two swipes leaves a good color on your lids and its not as bright and garish at all.<br /><br />I have no issues with creasing or flaking at all.

I also bought a smudge brush to apply it with, one of the shorter stiffer eye shadow brushes, which works great.<br />The only con is that it does crease, but I tried using an eye shadow primer and that fixed it wonderfully.<br />I don't think it blends quite as well as powder shadow does, but that might also be a matter of practice, since I just started using cream shadow."

The colors on the natural set are gorgeous and I can still get away with using a couple as highlights over a good base, but I can't imagine wearing them on my lids on a hot day.

My issue, and thus the 2 star rating, is due to the longevity of the colors.  They faded quite badly after just a couple of hours.

I like the non-sparkly colors best but that's just because I'm not a sparkle girl. I bought the nudes and the moonlit jewels. Moonlit jewels actually would of been fine by itself since two of the colors in it are the same as the ones in the nudes.<br />My only complaint is the case, it's opens upside down from what you expect and takes a little getting used too.

I bought this in the &quot;Not Just Nudes&quot; palette, and I really feel like it was worth what I paid for. For me, I feel like creme shadow can be used as two things: primer and eyeshadow.  If you're running late, you simply just swipe your finger and you're done. The great creamy texture is great as a base, because then my powder shadow just stays right on it. On the down side, it does crease, but that's not too big a deal for me just because it saved me the money of buying legitamite(I probably spelled it wrong) primer, which is great."

The pigment is not a bold as I might like, but I also haven't really tested out how well it layers, so really it might not be a problem.  The lightest colour is a bit more matte than the other shades, so it is really great as a base.  The eyeshadow is creamy and as far as i can tell it doesn't seem to crease.

Not for a night out or special day. Using two to three colors was pretty easy for me but its not to long lasting. I would recommend for girls who are barely starting to use makeup."

"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","lola997","Chicago, Il",4,"I have been using this product without a primer, simply just getting some on my finger and applying it to the base of my eye (lightest color ) and maybe adding a mineral eyeshadow over it (a light shimmery brown). In the corners of my eye, I use the lighter brown color with shimmer to add some effect."
"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","Jenae H.","Omaha, NE",4,"I use this for school or work.  A nice, clean, natural look that highlights your eyes.  The only problem is even with an eyeshadow base, it creases throughout the day which can ruin the look.  Perhaps with a different base it would last.  The colors are so great I still use it, but I was disappointed by how quickly it creases."

"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","Pegbah","Chicago",4,"My preferred daily eyeshadow, in the NUDES palette (some of the other palettes have odd combos).  Applies easily and blends well, with moderate shimmer in all but the light cream shade (which could actually use a bit of shimmer).  Color stays true all day, with minimal creasing over time (crease can be blended later in the day to refresh the look).  My skin is 40+ and sensitive, and I've never had a problem with the NUDES or the PLUM palettes."

This inexpensive shadow quad is super nice!  I have 701 Wild Orchids (purple family) and 730 Skinlights (neutral).  They are super easy to blend and I like ALL of the colors!  The purples don't look like bruise colors on me...and I think either of these would work well with any eye color.  Very wearable with appropriate impact.  There is only a small amount of product per color but for the price I don't mind.  I will repurchase!  I could see myself using this as a base for build able looks too.  It didn't crease (on me), didn't smell weird or fade."

I use the Skinlights and Not Just Nudes sets every day.  My eyelids are sensitive and sometimes powder shadow is drying, but these never irritate or dry my eyelids.  They have a nice creamy texture, are very easy to apply and blend and you can layer on as much color as you want.  They do not have quite as much color saturation or staying power as pricier brands (I use Smashbox/Benefit/Urban Decay cream shadows as well)but that is to be expected. These are actually easier to blend than those higher-end brands and perform almost as well--at a much lower price point.  If you feel they fade too quickly, you can use primer or just a bit of foundation or concealer on your lids first, or dust a bit of translucent powder on top when you are finished.  If Revlon ever discontinues this product, I'll be hitting all the stores to stock up!"

Before I used brushes I just used a q-tip to apply this stuff and it still went on so smoothly! One thing to look out for is even though it is crease resistant, doesn't mean it is crease proof. Yes, it lasts quite a while before creasing, but I usually just check my eyelids after a few hours and blend with the tip of my finger and it's good as new!"

This eyeshadow wears off easily, even when I use a great primer. It also creases sometimes. But I really like how you take the product from the back so it always looks brand new, even when you have used it for quite a while. I also like how there is a mirror inside and it is inexpensive. I probably won't be purchasing this again though because it doesn't really work for me and I know that there are better eyeshadows out there. But my friend reccommended it to me and she says it works great for her, so I'm sure it works well for others too."

I got it in the palette &quot;not just nudes&quot; and they're just great colors for my style.  They were easy to blend and just simple enough to look like I'm wearing some eyeshadow to give a little more color but not too dark or flashy that they'd be weird to wear everyday.  I just really like how subtle they are so I can wear them more often out and about.  I applied with my fingers and they are just so creamy and pigmented, just so easy to apply."

I didn't read the packaging clearly, though, and was surprised and disappointed when I saw these were creme. I tried using these as shadows and liners, but I gave up after a while because they were creasy and not very flattering or easy to work with. I found a use for them (FINALLY) as an eyeshadow base. They allow for more color to be built up on top of it. Otherwise, I would throw it out."

I love makeup and recently I had bought creme shadows from other brands so I saw that Revlon had a creme shadow also. I wanted to try it out, so when I went to the Ulta store I bought it. I tried it on and I have to say its one of the worst eyeshadows I have ever had. It crease, doesnt blend well at all, and the colors were not vibrant like i wanted. These eyeshadows are to creamy to do anything with, and they wear off within the hour. All and all I will be returning to my local Ulta store."
"http://www.ulta.com/illuminance-creme-shadow?productId=42294","Sarah","Canada",4,"I've been using this eye shadow in different color pallets for the last six years and I've really enjoyed it compared to other drugstore eye shadows. This particular pallet is the best I've used for a more natural look and it really compliments blue eyes well. I've never used an actual primer with it but instead use a small bit of concealer sealed with powder before applying this. When you use it without any type of primer it will look less pigmented and more natural which is fine with the lighter colors but the darker brighter ones are better if you prime your eyes. This eye shadow will usually hold up well with water but does tend to crease and fade after 6+ hours."

I didn't realize they were cream shadows and not powder. The cream applies very patchy for me whether I use a brush or my finger. If I try to build the color up it gets cakey.
