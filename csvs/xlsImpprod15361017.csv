"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Rabz","California",5,"It's a cream formula that is really pigmented. It's very easy to use and you can get an easy glam look with little effort; I usually just add a crease color and add this over the lids, or just a bit in the center of the lid to brighten the look. I like that the bottles are compact and come with a small brush that you can easily travel with."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Unsolicited Advice Giver","Dayton, OH",5,"I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING BUT CREME EYESHADOW EVER AGAIN. This product is indeed A1. Perfect. Works so well when blended, it's definitely sparkly, but not crazy, overbearing. I can also wear it aal day to work, home, take a long nap, get up and drive for a few hours and when I come home it still looks FLAWLESS. This product is a miracle in the form of eyeshadow. Highly recommend. I've told everyone about this product and if you haven't bought it yet, you're seriously missing out."

It's good for everyday wear or subtle for the office, but I really don't see a lot of color saturation. It does last all day, so you don't have to worry about it fading. It just doesn't have very much color payoff. I do like it for work or just daily wear. If subtle is what you want, then this is for you."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Kate","St. Louis.",5,"Love this. As great as expensive brands. I applied the benefit primer, then powder shadows in the crease, then this cream eyeshadow all over the lid. Love it. Would recommend it to a friend."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","teddybear","Puyallup, WA",3,"The color looked great in the compact but was much lighter when applied.  The brush that came with it isn't good for applying and i didn't think it stayed on as well."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","LC Poyner","Garner, NC",5,"I've been using this shadow every day. It is so smooth and goes on easily. It blends well with my other shadows--cream or powder.  I'm so glad I bought this product!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Gina","Auburn, MI",1,"I don't like the application brush. I don't think the product applies as it appears on the photos in the store. It smudges and it doesn't blend well with other shadows."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","T","San diego",1,"I was expecting a nice smooth eye shadow that didn't crease or have to be clumped on in order for it to look like you put it in.  I don't recommend this particular eye shadow."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Terrimerry","Orlando, Fl",5,"It's hard to find creme eyeshadow....let alone with it's own built-in brush...and a nice one at that! Would like more matte choices in this product....too many sparkly colors. However the 2 matte colors (#s 715 &amp; 720) that i bought I just love. Perfect for older skin as it keeps your lids from looking creased as dry eyeshadows can."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","dbaz","Arizona",5,"I apply this eyeshadow with my finger and wear with mascsara a quick smudge of eyeliner for a fast natural makeup look."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","peaceloverodeo","Denver, NC",3,"I purchased this because I was hoping it may be a cheaper alternative to some of my favorite brands..however I was disappointed. This eyeshadow goes on fairly well and the colors are beautiful, however they crease not long after application, even with primer (I use Too Faced.)"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Amy","Overland Park, KS.",5,"I think that this is SO great! I have tried many cream eyeshadows and a lot either just crease easily and slide off or try down too quickly and are hard to blend. I bought two shades and was able to create a natural eye look in less than 5 minutes. I did use an eyeshadow primer underneath but I never wear eyeshadow without one."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Mid-aged broad","Rockford IL",3,"I wanted to buy the Ulta brand of powdered eyeshadow, but their shelves were totally empty.   The cashier told me that she thought that the company was in the middle of 'repackaging' that product.  Not very believable.   Why not post a sign on the empty shelves?  I settled for the product I bought because I needed something in the meantime.   It's  okay, but I prefer the powdered eyeshadows."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Ren","Fayetteville, NC",1,"I saw this on Facebook last night and was super excited to go buy it. I am an avid makeup user and I use all types of makeup from brand names to drugstore brands. I was highly disappointed with this product. I bought creme brulee, which was way too light for me. It barely shows up. I also applied an eye shadow primer before hand. Within an hour it was already creased and flaking off. To top it off, it made my eyes super itchy. I will be sticking with Urban Decay, Too Faced and Tarte eye shadow products. You get what you pay for!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Heather","Plainfield, IN",5,"The only complaint I have on this line is that there aren't more colors available. (And there are quite a few!) Would love to see some bolder metals (deep purple, bright blue, etc)"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","bacd","Michigan",5,"I recently bought and tried two of these: 705 (creme brulle) and 710 (caramel). I was able to build layers of color, no creases or flaking at the end of the day. Very pretty, smooth, elegant. I can't wait to get a few more colors."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Spenser","Princeton, NJ",5,"I have the shades Caramel and Praline and absolutely adore them both. I haven't tried applying them with the built-in brush yet, but I tend to prefer applying cream shadow with my finger anyway, and they apply beautifully that way. Both with and without a primer, these last all day on me with no creasing and no fading. The colors are both gorgeous and have the perfect amount of subtle-ish shimmer for my taste. My only gripe is that they aren't opaque enough to cover the veins on my lids; however, because they're more of a wash of color, they're very easy to blend out seamlessly even without a separate crease shade. I plan on picking up more shades, and I hope that the formula is just as good as the ones I have - it seems from other reviews that they may not be."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","K","Chicago",1,"I bought the Praline colorstay creme eyeshadow because it was such a pretty color.  It did apply very smoothly with the little brush that comes with it.  The brush may be small, but it surprisingly does a great job.  The issue for me was that it was a bit too sparkly and the initial application that was so beautiful, wore off way too quickly, leaving behind some sparkles, but no color.  I just need to realize that these creme drugstore eyeshadows do not work well for me."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","RachRiot","Michigan",3,"I thought this was a good cream eyeshadow. I got the shade 730 Praline, which is a nude rose gold shimmer. The shade is absolutely stunning, very Victoria's Secret. It's easy to apply all over the lid with your fingertip and then you're good to go, if you just want to leave it at that. It's a thin consistency (for instance, the Maybelline Color Tattoos are quick thick by contrast), but still a very smooth and even application, which is nice because I don't have to tug on my eyelids at all. I will say that I didn't think it was all that and a bag of chips in terms of buildable impact- you can layer but I found it didn't amp the pigment up too much- but I do like it for hurried mornings where I need to get to work but want to throw *something* on my eyes. It does crease a little if I blend it up too far, so watch out for that. I don't think I will purchase other shades- I have tried other cream eyeshadows that I do like better in terms of wear time, less creasing, and just more oomph for the price. It's nice though, and shade 730 is stunning!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","lizziefs","Napa California",5,"I'm a cream eye shadow junkie. I have super oily lids and all shadows will eventually crease on me, yes even with a primer. With that said I always use a cream eye shadow as a base and an eye shadow primer. The second I put my finger in this pot I thought whoa these feel just like my shisedo cream eye shadows which are the only cream eye shadows that do not crease. The only problem is that the shades in the Shisedo line are not the best. Now these Revlon eye shadows have shades that are calling my name they even have a few matte colors. Now the matte colors are a little finicky and can be a bit patchy if you don't blend like your life depended on it right away, and I mean blend girl don't apply then go to the bathroom or do something else just blend. I love these. I just do and for the price you can't beat it."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","nikod","chicago",2,"I have the shades pistachio and caramel. Caramel is AMAZING and a near dupe for the Tom Ford bronze duo. It stays on all day, no creasing, and can hold a lighter highlight on top of it. It also blends into a transition shade nicely.<br />Pistachio, however, is JUNK. At 11a, after applying my makeup around 7a, there was almost nothing left. And it was all bunched up in the creases of my eyelid. I used a primer and my milk pencil to draw out the color but this still happened.<br />Unfortunately for me the bad outweighs the good. I also have black currant so we'll see how that holds up."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Neylon","CT",5,"I heard one of my favorite beauty gurus Tati rave about this product. I tried it and fell in love! Very pigmented and creamy and I love the little brush it comes with. Would purchase again and again!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Jess","Dale City, VA",4,"I bought this product in the shades black currant and pistachio and I think they're pretty good. At first I was a little nervous because they feel really greasy when you dip your finger into the pot (I like to apply crease shadows with my finger) but once you apply it to your eye it does dry down. Again, because of the greasy feeling I thought it would crease throughout the day but I had both of them on for over 12 hours and had zero creasing. I do recommend applying the product with the built in brush or your own brush though because using my finger did move the shadow around and it didn't look smooth and even. With the brush, the pigment is much better and applies more evenly."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Lee lee","New York, ny",5,"Super creamy and blendable I love to use this as an eyeshadow base. It is long-lasting and perfect for doing cut creases. Much cheaper and better quality than mac paint pots. The only thing I do not like about it is the packaging and the fact that it comes with a flimsy flat eyeshadow brush thought kind of transfers the Black Ink onto the product when you use it."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Olive","Las Cruces, NM",5,"I'm seriously so in love with these. They are amazing for a simple everyday look. I slap a light brown color all over my lid and crease and then 710 Caramel for a warm look, or a dull red all over the eyes and 730 Praline on the lid for a peachy look. They stay all day in the heat, in the cold, in the rain, in shine, and they don't crease. However, I don't have particularly dry or greasy lids. They add a perfect shimmer and subtle glitter that you really can't achieve with a powder shimmer eyeshadow. The one thing I can't stress enough is DON'T USE THEM WITH THE BRUSH! They look absolutely awful and crumbly with the brush, and you won't get any color payoff. Simply use your finger! You won't regret these."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","lelmore907","TN",5,"I love these cream eyeshadows. The brush that comes with it in the lid works really well. The staying power is awesome and stays until you take it off."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","Vertigo","Texas",4,"I originally bought this in color 740, Black Current and LOVED it. Very easy to apply and the color lasted all day. I had a little bit of creasing but I have very hooded eyes with a lot of folds so I expected that. Still held up better than most powder shadows. I went back and bought 730, Praline and 745 Cherry Blossom. Praline was wonderful and gave me a lot of shimmer for very little work. I have very fair skin and this gave me just a touch of color for a simple work look.<br />Sadly Cherry Blossom wasn't so great. I found this on the be patchy and clumpy. I couldn't get the pigment to stick anywhere other than my crease and with my eyes that means the color was basically invisible. <br />That said, I still love the product overall despite one color not working out for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod15361017","HeIsTheZissou","Texas",5,"I bought 730 Praline and it's quickly become my go-to eye product. It's so easy to apply with my finger that I've never even bothered with the little brush that's included. I just swipe it on, blend out the edges with a clean finger, and I'm left with a pale rose gold color that lasts all day without fading. I also tend to have very oily eyelids that cause a lot of eye products to crease and break-up, but that hasn't been my experience with this one. I'm a big fan of cream eye shadows for their ease of use and this rivals my higher end Shiseido products, no problem. If you're a fan of cream eye shadows, I think you'll really enjoy this."
