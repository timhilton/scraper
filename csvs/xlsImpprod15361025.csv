It is able to get in every crease on your face and you are able to fill in every wrinkle and fine line that you have too. It's able to fit in all the hard to reach place around your eyes and nose with ease. I've tried lots of blending sponges, and this one is by far the best!

I like that when using this sponge, I don't have makeup all over my hands, and that it blends together the products that I use. I don't like that it does waste makeup or how big it is. It isn't a necessity for my makup routine so I don't see me using it very often. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.**<br />I have never used a blending sponge before, so it was an interesting learning experience for me. One that I'm glad that I had learned. With the blending sponge I was able to get better coverage with my cover up and of the Revlon Insta-Blush. I really love how close I was able to get to the corner of my eyes without smudging the make up that was already there! I'm going to go out and buy 3 or 4 more of these awesome blending sponges. Thanks to Crowdtap &amp; Revlon for introducing me to such an amazing product!"

It is nice to have a multi-use makeup tool, instead of lots of rarely used sponges and brushes. I used this sponge primarily to bake under my eyes and found the pointed end to be especially helpful for this. I would also use for foundation application and contouring. I also enjoyed the overall shape and texture of the sponge. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/4-in-1-blending-sponge?productId=xlsImpprod15361025","Caitybugg3446","Mount Vernon, KY",5,"This is the first makeup sponge I have ever owned and I am so glad I chose this one!  I have constantly looked for a sponge that would work for me and I haven't had any luck until I found this one. I really love that this sponge is shaped differently than other sponges out there. This sponge really gets into all those hard to get places. This sponge applies product smoothly and evenly, and doesn't streak. You can use this sponge for not only foundation but, with primers, contour, blushes, etc.. This sponge blends every product that I use perfectly and leaves my skin looking amazing and flawless. The sponge is nice and smooth, not rough at all. I am definitely glad I waited for this sponge! This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.&quot;      <br />I really like the feel of the Revlon 4-in-1 Blending Sponge. It has a great shape that lets you use it in numerous ways and it is easy to grip and use. Blends the makeup easily and smoothly.  The shape lets you get to places that are harder to get to or harder to do correctly with your fingers or other tools. I liked that it is soft but firm enough to do a good job of blending."

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.  I don't normally use a makeup/blending sponge so this was a new experience for me.  I used this product to apply a couple different liquid makeup primers.  The sponge itself is super soft, smooth and squishy.  It feels really nice on my skin.  I like the fact that there is a large surface area on the sponge for applying makeup/primer to larger areas of the face, such as the forehead and cheeks, as well as a narrow pointed area on the top to help apply products to smaller, hard-to-reach areas such as under the eyes and around the nose.  This sponge can be used not only to apply makeup/primer, but also to blend/blot, create contour and correct makeup mistakes.  It can be used with liquid or cream makeup, making it quite versatile.  This is a high quality product that I would recommend."
"http://www.ulta.com/4-in-1-blending-sponge?productId=xlsImpprod15361025","jbh","Chicago, IL",4,"I think the Revlon 4-in-1 blending sponge is great for people who are used to using sponges on their face.  I, personally, prefer to use my finger because I feel like it is more efficient and hygienic.  If I were to start using a sponge I think this would be a great one, though.  It has a base to it which makes it easy for even beginners to use.  The angle tip of the sponge is perfect for highlighting and contouring.  It does a good job of blending int he neck area and at the hairline without getting it all over your hair.  I like that the hot pink color shows when it needs to be cleaned or replaced without having it be white so it always looks gross.

That is all in the past now that I've found this sponge from Revlon. It makes it so much easier to apply my primer, concealer, and foundation. It blends easily and smoothly and creates a perfectly smooth canvas for my blushes and bronzers.

Works great with powder or liquid types.  Easy to contour the face with.

The pointed, tapered edge makes getting into corners and applying concealer a breeze.  You can carve out your face or make with ease.  The round end works just as well as any other beauty sponge on the market, in my opinion.  Plus, it looks like a little lipstick!  How cute is that!

This Revlon one felt awkward to use. It left streaks on my face and uneven patches that I had to go back and fix with my brushes. I did enjoy using the smaller end for under my eyes though. It helped me to apply my concealer a little better. The quality seemed good for the brand. It doesnt feel cheap or like its going to break down with like 2 uses, so I'm sure I can find something to use this for. <br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

At first I hated it, and was angry with Revlon for even trying to pass this off as a makeup sponge, but after a week of trying to work with it every day I've learned different ways of using it and now like the sponge for certain things. First of all it recommends wetting it, but I after soaking in a little tub of water and them squeezing it, it didn't seen to absorbed much water or squeeze out much water, It still felt like the same hard &quot;sponge&quot;. I like the rounded and flat tip side for blending out my concealer.  Then use the sounded base to blend out cream blush and cream highlighter.  <br /><br />What I don't like about the sponge is that I feel like it too dense and absorbs a lot of product. I also think it's a bit too long. I like the tip and the base but the middle part of it is too long. It doesn't fit in my hand nicely. I also think the tip end is too floppy, I wish it were a little more compact in length.<br /> <br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

Wetting it made it even bigger. Sure, this will help you cover more of your face quicker, but when it come to the more precise areas like underneath the eyes you just don't want all if that bulk.  <br /><br />The shape is this sponge is awful. With all if the off edges and angles it makes it difficult to grip and I found myself constantly readjusting hand. <br /><br />While this isn't the hardest sponge out there, it isn't nearly as plush as the more popular sponges. It's pretty stiff and silicone like, even after wetting. I found the texture lent to a streaky patchy uneven base. Didn't blend nearly as well as I had hoped. I've used liquid, cream, and gel foundations. None of them seemed to get along with this sponge. <br /><br />I did luke that it came with a nice sturdy drying and storage case.

The thin point was perfect for around my eyes and nose! Perfect!! The bottom was great for applying my foundation! and the sides helped me blend perfectly! I love that the case as a bottom that allows the product to dry but still be protected! I did find that it applied my foundation better if I dabbed it onto the sponge and then apply to my face as opposed to dotting the foundation on my face and then blending. If I dotted it on my face the sponge seemed to eat my foundation lol But not a drawback as I just dabbed it onto the sponge instead!

I love the packaging and I actually use the main part to store my blending sponge in. It has a rounded side which I apply most of my makeup with by blotting it on but it also has a very angled side and I used that under and around my eyes and around the creases of my nose.

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.&quot;<br /><br />So I got to try this product and have been using it for the past few weeks. I wanted to really get a feel for it before I left a review.  First of all, I have not used this type of sponge before, but have used the common sponges you see at the convenience stores, so this was my first time using a blending sponge that is shaped this way.  My initial thoughts were wow, I love the shape of this, I can get down under my eye and not have to pull on my lids. My second thought was wow this doesn't suck up all my product so it kind of reminds me of that silicone thing that's on social media.  In other words overall I was impressed and satisfied with the applicator, I was able to actually dab under my eye without having to pull it across, which always seems to wipe concealer away.  This sponge really allowed me to do the whole dabbing thing really well, and a plus was that while it did remove excess product it did not suck up all of it and kept a good amount of it on my face.  I also like the shape of it which allows me to get into creases and leave the make up on to set up.  i love this product the only thing is its a little firmer then I like, The sponges I use are very light usually when you squeeze them they have alot more give then this sponge. but that's probably why they suck up so much product.  Anyway Really like this and so glad I can clean it and keep using it."

It is a great texture and high quality. It works really well and helps me look my best! I was able to test this product for free in exchange for my honest review."

"http://www.ulta.com/4-in-1-blending-sponge?productId=xlsImpprod15361025","Sady","Rocky Mount, NC",3,"The one thing I liked most about this sponge was its versatile shape. The top half is perfect for blending the concealer on top of the cheekbones. The more pointy edge is good for getting into those corners around the nose and eyes. And the bottom half works just as well as the Beauty blender. My only complaint is that the sponge stays pretty wet, versus damp after wetting it, which tends to make the foundation a bit watery, and you end up needing more product. However, it does give a clean neat finish. Overall, if you are someone who spends $30 on a sponge, better to save your money and just buy this because its just as good. The only tip I would give is not running it under water for a long time before using. <br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

It doesn't really expands when I wet the sponge so it's staying really firm. With a firm sponge is basically hard to do makeup (at least for me) so then it has a really small coverage. With a firm sponge is also not so comfy to do makeup because...well it's firm and not nicely soft. The only thing I really like is the sharp end which is great for concealer.

The tip can be use to reach in hard areas. It can also to be used to correct which is very convenient for me. I don't have to put it down to grab a q-tip or a wipe. It can also be used to contour with. I like to do very thin fine lines. So this sponge works for that. I find it blends liquid foundation better than powder. Since the sponge is somewhat rough I feel like bounces the powder around. Also for blotting and blending i feel like i had to do gently, if not it starts wiping it off instead of blending it.

The tip of the sponge helped taking care of edges and tips especially around the eyes and nose area. The flat round portion helped blending the foundation like cheek and forehead. The only drawback is that a lot of product gets wasted in this blending sponge. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

Never tried the sponges. I like how it has a different angles to get in those hard to reach places near your nose and it blends well. It works great with Revlon foundations.

"http://www.ulta.com/4-in-1-blending-sponge?productId=xlsImpprod15361025","Laura","Michigan",2,"Although this is a dense sponge, it holds more water when wet and it is hard to squeeze it out just to get a dampened effect. It is a bit squelchy when you pounce and really waters down and sheers out liquid foundation. The tip, which I thought  would be great for getting around the eyes, is to floppy and has no stiffness to it so it ends up smearing instead of doing the job right. There are other sponges out there that do much better job."

"http://www.ulta.com/4-in-1-blending-sponge?productId=xlsImpprod15361025","reviewer","los angeles",2,"I loved the shape. It makes it easy to get into hard to reach places, and even though I was worried about the long tip being flimsy, I had enough control when using it under my eyes. And the bottom is perfect for the normal bouncing method of the rest of the face. There are definitely enough different areas to apply different cream products, like blush, bronzer, concealer, etc without mixing them. The thing that gives me mixed feelings about this sponge is the texture and material. I am used to the soft squishy sponges that feel very light. This sponge is hard, dense, and almost rubbery. Even though it expands when wet and used damp, it doesn't get softer. I could hear and feel it hitting my face when using it, which was not very enjoyable. The other thing this texture does is soak up products. I have to apply many layers of product because the first time or two i get almost no product on my actual face. It is all just soaked up into the sponge. I can get a flawless airbrushed coverage after 3-4 layers of product because it's already saturated with product. It seems wasteful and annoying since my other sponges don't do that. Plus it wastes time when I'm in a hurry. It is also annoying that each section of the sponge has to be essentially primed like this, soaking it in product, before being used. If I use the flat end of the sponge for foundation, I then have to use multiple layers of concealer too, because that concealer portion of the sponge soaks it all up. I can't even just use the big side for concealer because it is too big for around my nose and eyes. Other sponges you can use the big sides for small spaces just by squishing them a bit, but this revlon one can't be squished into areas, you just have to use the pointy side, which as I said, then needs to be primed with more product wasted.

I don't contour, but I find it works very well for other purposes. The sponge feels high quality and very solid, and so far I haven't experienced any breakage or damage through use. I've used it both wet and dry, and prefer wet for applying most products. When I've used it dry, I find it wastes too much product. The sponge does expand a bit when wet and takes some time to dry. The case is really useful to hold it while it's drying.

It easily gets to all of the corners that were hard to get to before and the material that it is made out of doesn't soak up all of your product like some sponges.  I didn't have any issues with uneven application or the sponge being too dense. I really loved how easy it was to comfortably hold in your hand and use because I am used to using sponges attached to a handle (similar to a make-up brush).  Plus, the little case it comes with is really a plus because I can throw it in my makeup bag and not worry about making a mess. I would highly recommend the Revlon 4-in-1 Blending Sponge.

It provides smooth coverage and makes it easy to remove excess makeup from my skin.  However, since I've been washing it after every use, I've found it has gotten a little out of shape, like there are indentions from squeezing the water out.

I wasn't sure how good it was going to work because I'm a devoted user of the beauty blender but I actually loved using this. It blended out my foundation seamlessly. I also love that it has the small tapered end because it could get into spots that I usually have trouble with when blending things out like around the creases of my nose and in the corners of my eyelids when blending out concealer. This sponge made it much easier and blended it out perfectly. It didn't make anything patchy and it didn't cling to any weird spots on my skin. It's a soft sponge and easy to use. The only thing is I wish it were a little bit bigger. But at the same time since it's not a hue sponge, it doesn't waste any product like some of the other sponges do that I've used.

To be truthful this is only the second sponge I have ever used. I like having the four sides or shapes for the different ways that makeup can be applied. I really like the slanted/pointed part of the sponge to apply makeup to the hard to blend areas like along the nose and under the eye. I did not really care for the other areas of the sponge. I can see using the other parts of the sponge when I have more time to devote to my makeup routine. Otherwise I found those areas of the sponge to be a little bit stiff and it took some time to blend the makeup into my skin. I like how the sponge looks like new red lipstick.

The Revlon 4-in-1 Blending Sponge was a lot bigger than what I was used to using. The sponge was also kind of stiff. Even after wetting it, it wasn't as soft as a Beauty Blender. But, it did an okay job at blending my foundation. Maybe after continued use, the sponge will soften some. I like that it comes with a case."

I wish the sponge material was a little bit softer, though. Sometimes I feel like I am beating myself up when I am dabbing on the product. The case is my favorite part!

The shape of the sponge threw me off quite a bit as it's not what I'm typically used to. I liked that with the tip of it, I could blend my concealer easily and nicely, but in terms of applying my foundation I wasn't as much of a fan. It's just a really awkward area of the sponge that you're supposed to blend your foundation with. It is also more spongey than I would like. I would prefer it to be softer instead of springy.

At first I thought that the case would only be discarded but I was very surprised that it can avctually be a permanent holder of the sponge and it even has holes on the bottom for airflow. The sponge is qute firm compared to my other sponge. At first I had to &quot;feel&quot; my way around the sponge as to how I can hold and make use of it according to my needs. What I like most about the sponge is the tapered part because it fits perfectly against my undereye area. The rounded bottom is what I usually use to apply my foundation.

Prior to the Revlon 4-in-1Beauty Sponge I was going back and forth with using brushes, finger tips, and/or a sponge. I was intrigued by the shape of it. The tip does in fact reach corners of my eyes and around my nose. I found it to be a little bit weird because of it size. Been using it for several weeks on and off and I'm still not used to that. The part recommended to use for besr full blending didn't work for me. Its the middle front part of the sponge. I felt it made the mouse like makeup too obvious. The bottom round part worked best for me! It made my skin look smooth and the foundation wasn't showing like before. Blotting the foundation is how this Revlon sponge worked best on my skin. I also liked it didn't absorb the product so it wasn't wasted. An added bonus is the case in comes in. It stores the sponge after each use and has a perferated bottom to keep the damp sponge from smelling bad. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.
