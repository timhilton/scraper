"http://www.ulta.com/diamond-collection-lash-curler?productId=xlsImpprod5100127","Girl next door","Dallas,  TX",5,"I have long but not curling lashes, this is the best curler I have yet to come across. I use it before and after applying mascara and my curl last all day. Some days I'm not feeling the mascara so I'll use it to just curl my natural eyelashes bit doing that usually requires me to curl again mid day."

We actually gave up and bought our old one we've used for years.  We only bought this one because of the bling and we thought it would curl our lashes even better than our old stand-by, but we were wrong."

"http://www.ulta.com/diamond-collection-lash-curler?productId=xlsImpprod5100127","Deborah","San Antonio",5,"When I first bought this I was disappointed, it wasn't the same kind of Revlon eyelash curler I had in the past. The one I had, that I loved had a spring attached to it.  When I used it the first two times it didn't work. But after using it for a week it started to curl my eyelashes. Idk if it was just my eyelashes or the rubber insert needed time to mold to my eye but it is great now. I have the expensive brands and honestly you can't beat the price for these. I will definitely continue to use Revlon eyelash curlers"

"http://www.ulta.com/diamond-collection-lash-curler?productId=xlsImpprod5100127","Sharon","Milwaukee, WI",1,"the curling part is too wide for my eyes so it only catches the very end of my lashes OR it catches my skin and pinches.  I would never buy this again."

"http://www.ulta.com/diamond-collection-lash-curler?productId=xlsImpprod5100127","Shawn","Denver",1,"I purchased this to replace an eye lash curler that is about 25 years old.  I will keep using my antique eyelash curler, as this one does not curl my lashes.<br />I guess the old adage is true....&quot;they don't make them like they used to&quot;."

"http://www.ulta.com/diamond-collection-lash-curler?productId=xlsImpprod5100127","Heather","Olathe, KS",1,"This was my first foray into eyelash curlers and it was not a good one. I have a pretty standard eye shape, not too small but not too large, and this did not fit the shape of my eye very well. I do not have the longest eyelashes and found it very difficult to get my eyelashes in the contraption (couldn't get it close enough to the root of my lashes). Aside from not fitting the shape of my eye very well it also did not curl well. I heated it up a lil bit with my blow dryer hoping that would help hold the curl better and that did not work at all. I applied mascara (Clinique Chubby Lash mascara) as fast as I could and they were up a lil bit more than normal but by the end of the day they were back to their normal shape. Save up some money and buy a better curler."

"http://www.ulta.com/diamond-collection-lash-curler?productId=xlsImpprod5100127","agreen","Ann Arbor, MI",2,"It doesn't really curl the eyelashes that great.  You really have to squeeze hard to get it to work. I have had better ones that were less money."

It gives it very little bend and it would get all my lashes. For another few $$ more I purchased tarte eyelash my favorite 2nd one I had been through. It's worth spending extra for a great curl"
