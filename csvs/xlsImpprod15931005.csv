I tried it out over the course of a week, trying it with different products over the top and by itself, to see if that made a difference.<br /><br />Pros: the applicator is nifty!  Definitely want to use it; don't use your fingers.  I like how it smells--it's faint, though, if you don't care for it.  It's translucent-ish, so it'll work on multiple skin tones.  And my favorite part is that it's curiously soothing.  It's actually cooling when you put it on.  You know how it feels when you pet cool sheets?  It feels like that.  Not wet, but sort of like it.<br /><br />Cons: it doesn't do anything.  Which is a pretty big con.  I don't have a lot of wrinkles yet, but I do have very faint ones coming up around my eyes, and they were still very much present.  I tried it on my large-ish pores around my T-zone, and it did better there!  About as well as Pore-fessional, which honestly hasn't been particularly successful on me, but there you go for comparison.  It smoothed things out for a little while, but around hour 3 it was starting to look a little...gummy.  And around hour 8 or so, it had actually started making my foundation look patchy, where I wasn't greasy.  I have pretty dry skin, so for me to look greasy, that's a very bad sign.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because I really do like that applicator.  At least I didn't have to pay for it.  Save your money."

"http://www.ulta.com/youth-fx-fill-blur-primer-faceneck?productId=xlsImpprod15931005","Not Another Nickname","Dallas TX",4,"I received this free from Ulta.  I was truly skeptical.  I am 62 years old and have light wrinkles around my eyes.  I applied my moisturizer first and then this.  It works well as a light blurring technique.  Wrinkles do not disappear entirely but they are less noticeable."

"http://www.ulta.com/youth-fx-fill-blur-primer-faceneck?productId=xlsImpprod15931005","ZeusMama","Los Angeles",3,"I received a generous sized sample of this from Ulta. <br />Does it &quot;blur lines&quot;? Definitely. Does it get rid of lines? No... although I don't know that it actually claims to. <br />As a primer, this is so thick, it fills in lines, making them &quot;disappear&quot; under your makeup. <br />If that's what you're looking for, it works great. I personally just don't like to wear such heavy products on my face. It has a really heavy, zinc-oxide type texture, leaving a really carry texture I don't care for."
