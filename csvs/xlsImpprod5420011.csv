"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Susan","Wisconsin",5,"I love the light feel, general wear time, and colour selection of this lip gloss. The container is a little big for a pocket, but it is wonderfully moisturizing which more than makes up for this inconvenience.  I would definitely recommend this product."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Sheterra Sanders","Florida",5,"I love these lip glosses. They are Moisturizing and glossy. The remind me of Mac cremesheen without the color payoff. I wish these glosses were more pigmented but everything else about them are fab! Loves it"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","The Office Flan","Bartlesville, OK",4,"I don't normally like lipglosses, but these are very nice. They are moisturizing and not at all sticky, and the color payoff is pretty good. Much better than many other drugstore lipglosses (I'm looking at you, Covergirl)."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Rennyt31","FL",3,"Nice product for a sheer lipgloss. Kinda pricey but you get a lot of product. Clean classic pretty packaging. Very comfortable. Lasts longer than NYX butter lip glosses."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Faith","Indianapolis, IN",5,"I bought this product in &quot;Kiss Me Coral&quot;. It is the perfect color for this summer season. Its the perfect shade, not too sheer, but not too bright. I find the formula very moisturizing, and just the right consistency. It doesn't have much of a scent, but this is a plus for me. Overall, it is a great product, and i will most likely be buying more shades in the near future :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","amilly","ma",4,"Not to sparkly,dont let the gold shimmer in tube stop you from buying it,it doesnt show the glitter. A great gloss for the perfect peachy nude lip."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Busylee","Missouri",2,"I purchased this gloss for the color - a newer, trendy color that is currently hard to find. I thought it would be good going into late summer and fall. The color is called &quot;Raisin&quot; something or other, a rich brownish-brick.<br />However, when I put the gloss on - it is quite sheer. Not what it looks like in the tube. It spreads out to a brighter berry color. Ok, but not what I wanted. I will be returning it."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","DJ","Virginia Beach, VA",4,"I use the product daily.  It is my &quot;go-to&quot; lip gloss.  I wear it especially when I wear natural earth-tone shades and or colors that go well with peach/orange colors.  (I also like another color from this line that comes in a pinkish shade for when I wear red or pink.)  I wish the color would last longer and not have to be reapplied as often; but I manage with it as it is."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Gabriella","Winnetka, Ca",5,"Love this product. I've used this for years!!! 90% of the time I wear the nude color but I own several other colors that they have. I rarely wear the pigmented versions alone. I usually add it to a lipstick or lipstain just because super lustrous wears off so easily so I like to have a longer lasting lip product underneath. If there's any streaking or dryness, this gloss evens out the whole look and keeps my lips moisturized. But I literally wear this product every single day. Even at night while I'm asleep! That's how lovely it is. I can't stand Chapstick or any other of the 20+ different &quot;moisturizing&quot; lip products I've used. The next best lip moisturizer would be a product by neutrogena but nothing that moisturizes provides color like super lustrous by revlon. The color pay off is very good."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","TBAmommy","Phoenix, AZ",2,"This gloss may be nice if you are looking for a sheer hint of color. However, I was hoping for more opaque pigmentation."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Jamie","Burlington, NC",1,"This gloss formula is very thin and wears off easily.  I think a thicker slightly sticky consistency stays on longer.  The old version of this gloss in the square tube was EXCELLENT!  Please bring back the &quot;old&quot; formula and colors!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Olive","CO",4,"While there was definitely some color payoff, it wasn't nearly what I expected when purchasing such a bold color. However, it gives a nice flush of color for everyday and feels great on the lips- both hydrating and not sticky at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Dee","Hampton,Ga",3,"The color in the tube does not appear on your lips, and I was expecting a little more shimmer on my lips. Try a little flavor in you glosses!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","lipstickcrazy","Metro east illinois",4,"I've used these before and gave them as gift because hey SALE. The colors are beautiful and the gloss formula was easy for my friend to use as she's just beginning to use lip products."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Red","Duncanville, TX",5,"This product kept my lips moist and I only had to re apply if I wiped it off."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Sierra","Nacogdoches, Tx",4,"This product is not opaque, but I do love the color it gives. I own it in the color pinkissimo and find that it is the perfect glossy slightly pink lip for me. If you have a darker skin than my pale self you might find it a tad frosty. The best part about this gloss is the shimmer is intense without being chunks of glitter that will stay around the edge of your mouth after the color has worn away- in fact I find the color to wear off pretty evenly. This gloss does have the typical stickiness a gloss has, but it is not a distracting amount. The smell is there, but not overpowering and slightly pleasant."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","spunky","waukegan, IL",1,"I put more than one layer of the gloss on and still you could barely see any of the color in the middle of my lips but it sure did show around the edges and it looked bad."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Farishta824","Philadelphia, PA",2,"Not impressed with the formula, I didn't like how the color was not vibrant for a hot pink. It looks very dull on the lips, more mauve if anything."

It's like an old friend that no matter what is always there for me whenever I need it.<br /><br />I like its shine and thickness. It has a very faint smell, so faint I can't compare it to anything. It stays on my lips as long as I don't eat it (I have a tendency to lick my lips :/). Good moisturizer for dry climate. By far my fave shade."

I have been experimenting with red as well, something else I avoided because of my full lips. However, I feel more comfortable with this than the overly prices NARS matte red lip stick I purchased. It also itsn't drying which is great."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Ariane","MD",5,"This lip gloss is not sticky nor does it dry my lips. Sandstorm is a pretty color for a nude or natural look."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Anonymous","Austin Texas",5,"I had my eyes on this baby for the longest time. I really wanted the shade &quot;Super Natural&quot; because it seemed like such a nice, pretty, everyday go to gloss. And that is EXACTLY what it is. I was so happy when I finally decided to buy it. I wear it almost everyday and I think it just pulls that natural makeup look off so well. It's a gloss, so it doesn't last through things like meals or snack that well but it doesn't transfer too much when I drink things. I do have really fair skin and this shade does not look dark on me all all."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Chi","Baltimore, Maryland",4,"The product applied evenly and was extremely glossy until it completely rubbed off but it smelled sort of like robittussin or something like that... some sort of medicine."

Looked great in the container but the color doesn't wear the same on me. Basically, ends up being just a regular lipgloss.<br /><br />Nice if you are just looking for a basic lipgloss, but not a lot of color."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","pinkpanther59","Tualatin",4,"Snow pink looks pink in the container, but it actually goes on clear. Super glossy looking. Supernatural is just about the perfect shade for maybe just about everyone. Its not over the top, but gives your lips a kitten amount of color. Rosy Future is lovely as well. Its of course sheer but with a bit more pink (red) to it, incase Supernatural is too light of a color for you."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Von","The Woodlands, Tx",1,"I purchased this and thought it would have at least a mild coverage.  Its too sticky and I will not buy it again."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Olivia","Portland Maine",2,"I bought this product in the Skin Pink color because I wanted a really light and pretty pink for creating natural looks. When I first applied it it wasn't great but I liked the color so I left it on, about ten minutes later it turned into this awful consistency and was clumping on my lips, absolutely horrible. I was very disappointed by this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Cassie","Houston, Texas",5,"I bought from this line specifically because I wanted something light and glossy, and it's exactly that! It's applicator brush is a perfect size and the tube has quite a lot of content in it! I got it in the color &quot;Sky Pink&quot; and love it's fresh, light feel. It is a bit sticky at first so when it's windy outside so you'll definitely get your hair stuck on your lips but that's just apart of wearing lip gloss! It doesn't have a scent at all and and doesn't taste like anything either so it's not uncomfortable to wear. It does wear off so I'd recommend reapplying every hour. Still worth the buy!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Lulu","Bangor, Maine",5,"I use this product everyday. Works well by itself for a little color or over a lip stain to give a bit of gloss. I have one in every bag and ever jacket. Xoxo"

The color Pango Peach is a true pink coral color<br />and absolutely beautiful, plus it stays on well and stays glossy along time...always buy 2 at a time, don't want to be without it , one for my purse,  one for my makeup table..<br />Revlon has always been #1 in lipsticks and glosses for reasonable price too."

The gloss has some thickness to it but doesn't last as much as I'd like. It's more like a every day use gloss instead of a special occasion makeup.

I don't have that one so i can't say if it is or isn't, but its a very pretty, soft milky pink. It just doesn't seem like the smoothest, opaque app. and can get a tad goopy. but it is very pretty if you like soft, cool tone pinks."

When it is first applied it doesn't seem very deep in color but within a few minutes it gets deeper and more beautiful.  It WILL mildly stain your lips, but I don't mind, and I actually like that.  I have very dry lips with noticeable cracks and this gloss is incredibly moisturizing.  It evens out my lips and makes them appear fuller.  I will definitely be buying other colors of this soon!"

"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Jlough","MI",4,"The bareminerals glosses are my all time favorite - these glosses compare to it. The consistency is a tad less thick, which I think makes it a little less long-lasting. But! I love these for the price. I wouldn't say they are as opaque as the bareminerals either but I actually don't mind that for everyday use! Considering glosses wear less time anyways."

Lucky I found it in the store, which I bought 1 and 2nd for half price.  The second color I bought to try is Pango Peach. My only con is need more color selection.  I love that it apply very easy and not sticky like most other lip gloss do. Will buy again."

Also, it does not look like the color it should be when you put it on.<br />Did not last long either.  I won't be buying it again."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","HotLAVA","Tennessee",3,"I purchased the Colorburst Lipgloss in Peony along with a Revlon Super Lustrous Lipgloss as a part of the Buy 1 Get 1 50% off deal. The Colorburst comes in a cute, slender tube. The color is pretty on my fair skin. However, the texture of the gloss leaves much to be desired. It's slightly clumpy because of the micro-glitter/shimmer and can feel tacky on my lips if I don't reapply about once per hour. I thought Revlon's Super Lustrous Gloss was FAR superior. Given that, I wouldn't purchase the Colorburst Lipgloss again knowing there are better choices for the same price within Revlon's line."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-lustrous-lipgloss?productId=xlsImpprod5420011","Tarik","Baltimore, MD",5,"I am totally in love with this gloss! A single coat gives just the right amount of pigmentation and shine for a casual, sheer pop of color. A couple extra coats gives you more color and TONS of shine! I have this in Sugar Violet and I love to layer it over a red lipstick to give more depth and a purplish hue to the color. This is also very hydrating as glosses go. If I can't find a balm, sometimes I just wear this to bed. It also smells nice, like butter and sugar kind of. Not sure if this was intentional but I like it. Highly recommend it!!!"
