I have oily skin and the waterproof one doesn't have me looking like a raccoon buy the end of the day.  It did add volume and length to my short lashes, but the waterproof formula may cause a little clumping if you apply too many coats and let them dry between.  But nothing a lash comb can't fix. <br /><br />To the above comment, I don't think that its the brush wand falling off, the mascara has fibers in it to add volume.  The package itself says there are fibers."

When I opened this up it was fine, but when I went to use it the next day the mascara wand fibers were falling off. I had to throw away without even trying it out."

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361775","haleylil","Louisville",4,"Not perfect because it does start to flake after a while (I'm bad about rubbing my eyes though. And this is a fiber formula mascara.). However I am in looove with the brush! I get perfectly wispy lashes with this mascara. The fibers do lengthen as well. It's not the most volumizing honestly, but I'm okay with trading some volume for excellent definition. I hate clumpy lashes and this does not clump!"

It doesn't add length at all, I have very long eyelashes and it would make them look shorter somehow. It actually pulled my eyelashes out. It never completely came off.

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361775","Stingray Girl","Chicago, IL",2,"I really wanted to like this new formulation, but it just didn't measure up to the old &quot;bold lacquer- length and volume&quot;.  I tried the blackest black.  I have regular sized lashes and love to use a formula that will give volume and length and make them really pop without being clumpy or too wet.  This did not clump, but wouldn't really build either.  It was just right as far as formula goes- not being dry or wet.  So if you are looking for a regular mascara this is it for you.  Really loved the old bold lacquer."

It did give a little volume, but not as much as had hoped for, even after 3 or 4 coats.  The lengthening factor is almost non-existent for me.  It also seems very dry which probably keeps it from doing what I had hoped for."

I saw revlon came out with a new mascara line so I'd thought I'd try it out. I picked this one up and OMG THE BEST DRUGSTORE MASCARA EVER! I do not notice that it flakes and it stays on all day and adds a ton of length and volume, highly recommend"

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361775","Kabukik","San Diego, CA",2,"I bought this mascara with high hopes and it has let me down, in a big way!<br />It promises volume and length but it doesn't deliver in the length in a single way, my lashes don't appear longer at all; also I noticed that it has some kind of long fibers, probably for the lengthening, but they just got into my eyes and clogged the brush. <br />And when it comes to the volume, it does give them definition but if I am not careful when layering you will end up with tarantula lashes, and I hate that.<br />It did last quite a long time without smudging and it barely flaked, but I had the waterproof version. It is a dry formula, at least mine was, I didn't care, but it made application a bit more difficult and clumpy.<br />I won't repurchase this mascara again."

Sadly, I have to retract.<br /><br />After about a week of using this mascara with solid results it just stopped working.  The product didn't dry up it didn't get contaminated it just stopped holding curl or extending length.  My lashes were still black, but just straight and stubby looking.  Volume started to turn into clumps.  Then flakes began appearing on my lower lids and cheeks.  So disappointing!<br /><br />The good news is that the week after I got a great coupon for ALMAY MASCARA and gave it a go.  After reading dozens of reviews I picked their One Coat Get Up And Grow lengthening.  Man does this stuff WORK!!!  As of today I have wore both the regular and waterproof for over a month.  This mascara just does not quit when it comes to making your lashes super long.  If you have trouble with your lashes holding a curl you should 100% check out ALMAY.  Leave the Revlon alone.<br /><br />All in all Revlon is in the trash but I am thrilled to find a winner with ALMAY!  Too this product could not hold up beyond initial use.  Bummer, Revlon..."

I had previously been using Chanel's Le Volume, and this one by Revlon is 10 times better for a fraction of the price. A single coat gives me great volume, a little length, and gives great curl and lift to my naturally straight lashes. Unlike many other voluminous fiber mascaras I've tried, I can apply this at 7:30a.m. and at 11:00p.m. it has not flaked or smudged at all. And as a dry-eyed contact wearer, this does not irritate my eyes at all. Cannot recommend enough!"

"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361775","Adrienne","Lafayette, LA",2,"Previously I had used Revlon's Bold Lacquer mascara for 2 years with no complaints. Now with the new mascara line replacing all previous options I find myself highly disappointed. First, there is no way to visually see the brush shape prior to purchase. Second, I find the formula to be dry and thin in coverage. While I will agree that it provides length the volume is lacking. Overall, I find the formula to be a huge disappointment: thin, prone to flaking, dry, &amp; volume-less. I will not be purchasing any of the new Revlon mascaras again, you pay for what you get."
"http://www.ulta.com/volume-length-magnified-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361775","Kapaawahine","Dana Point, CA",5,"Ok, so I have never reviewed a makeup product but Revlon Volume + Length is so amazing I just had to!<br /><br />This mascara is insanely great and I am 100% satisfied.  It applies easily and has a great brush.  No clumps or flakes through the day.  My lashes look long, thick and healthy.  When I first tried this mascara I had low hopes.  I have been through a bunch of mascaras lately since giving up my Benefit a year ago. <br /><br />I dropped Benefit 'They're Real' because honestly it was good but not great.  I also noticed in pictures that it made me look like my lashes were sparse.  Well I have happily found my go to mascara and I hope Revlon never discontinues it!  This mascara literally makes my lashes look like they touch my eyebrows.  The black is dark but not phony dark.  The application is on the drier side which I prefer.  My lashes tend to lose their curl and a dry mascara freezes them on the spot.  This mascara really holds my curl with zero falling.<br /><br />I would say to just give this one a shot.  Most recently I tried Clinique (good, but not budget friendly), Cover Girl (lame), three types of Essence (just ok) and Almay (getting better then in the past but still not a contender) and this tops them ALL!!!<br /><br />Thank you REVLON :)"

This one is good if you want to avoid smudging or raccoon eyes, but it does need reapplication throughout the day. I'm more impressed with the 5 in 1 version of this product (same look but with red cap by revlon) as far as adding length and curl, but that one needs reapplication as well.
