I use them everyday whether I'm going out or going to work. There is not a lot of eyeshadows that have glitter in them. I am soooo obsessed!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Malinda","Upper Darby, PA",5,"I cannot believe that I'm just discovering these and that's only because of the buy 2 get 1 Ulta was running on Revlon products that caused me to browse. I bought 3 different colors, Green Glimmer(more like a turquoise), Lilac Luster, and Burnished Bling. I loved them all so much that I just ordered Dessert Dazzle today from another site when I came across it. I read many mixed reviews about the application and the finished look of this product and I have figured all the negative reviews come from improper application, because I had NO problem with the application process and all 3 colors have turned out amazing on me. I love the eyeshadow part.. It's pigmented smooth looking, and dried quickly. I'm very careful not to apply it above my crease though or it will crack/crease. I only apply it the outer 3/4 of my eyelid than apply a lighter shade to the inner corner and do the rest of my eye makeup as usual. I do have to put a light cover of regular shadow on top so that it blends in with my crease color. I love the glitter part just as much. I'll usually apply a layer right above my normal black eyeliner. I do half away across my eye then dip  it back in to finish other half and that makes sure I get good and even pigmentation and glitter across entire eye. I'll also put a line of the glitter right in the outer half of my crease line (like a cut crease) sometimes to make my eyes pop more if I use a darker color for my crease. Just gotta make sure to keep eyes closed for a minute for it to dry. I really am already addicted to this product... It brings such a beautiful look to my eyes and has  drawn many compliments. My fiancee loves the way it looks! My mission is to own all of the colors within the month!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","MJ","Philadelphia, PA",1,"I was so excited to try this, and it looks amazing on, but immediately started burning my eyelids. I tried to wait it out to see if it would stop, but it didn't. Luckily, it came off with a wipe and the burning stopped. Bummer because the color and sparkle is fantastic."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","DetroitGal","Detroit suburb area",5,"I LOVE this cream eye shadow! I am talking about the Lilac color. The sparkly color is TOO sparkly and looks like I'm a &quot;working girl&quot;.  The Lilac color is Amazing! It is the perfect shade of purple. I get complements ALL THE TIME. I wear it everyday for work.  The color lasts my whole 12-hour shift and does not come off nor smudge until I take it off. It dries very quickly so it does not blend well, but it doesn't bleed or move once you apply it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","ccarter","Oklahoma",3,"I like this product and it is long lasting. I use it on my lids because I have hooded eyes and anything shimmery normally transfers. this stays put! Having said that, this products takes FOREVER to dry down. FOR-EV-ER!!!! You put the color on, it takes 3-5 min, you put the glitter on, it takes 5+ min. Not to mention you have to do each eye separately so you are not closing both eyes at once. We are talking 15+ minutes for eyelids. I use this rarely because it takes so long to put on. I wish it would dry more quickly because I would use it all the time. It's just not that user friendly. I would go with Maybelline Color Tattoo, which dries instantly. I would recommend this with caution!"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","melindajoy926","PA",4,"Applies easily. Use wand to apply cream shadow, let dry...use tip brush to apply glitter goop, let dry. I found it creased and peeled on my inner eye corner, so I just apply shimmer shadow to my inner eye crease, but everywhere else it holds! I love the color options. It's not super glittery, but still sparkly enough for day or night use."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","kar","cave junction oregon",5,"Hard to find a purple I like and this was great."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Christina in Boston","Boston, MA",5,"Depending on the color you select and on your personal preferences, this product can be used for when you want to feel more glam or for a dressier day at work or out, especially since you can choose whether or not to use the glitter liner.  The cream base is highly pigmented with no transparency and dries to a satiny metallic. There is no shimmer or glitter in the base, only a metallic shine, which makes it versatile. Once you apply it, it will not budge! I swatched this on my hand initially and it was still there at the end of the day. Keep this in mind when applying! For those not accustomed to applying glitter liner or applying liner with a brush, it may take a little bit of you getting used to, but these color combinations are gorgeous and if you are hesitant about going all out with the look, you can try just lining from the outer corner to mid-lid. Enjoy experimenting!"

Smashbox now makes one that is good and I was going to splurge on that until a friend recommended this.  I tried it, expecting not to be impressed, but I was wrong.  It stayed on all day, no creases, even when outside in the makeup-melting heat &amp; humidity. The glitter stayed on also.  I was able to remove it all easily with some eyeshadow remover."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Flower Child","USA",3,"The concept for this product (cream eyeshadow with matching glitter that helps one avoid using messy loose glitter, I think) is a great one, but the product itself falls a little short. It is surprisingly long-lasting and crease resitant, though I did put the eyeshadow over a primer so I am not sure how it would do without that. The color is absolutely brilliant (I bought the &quot;Green Glimmer&quot; one which is actually more of a teal color), and while I think it would be great for going out, I wore it to work and received compliments. The glitter is not messy, and I have used it as liner and on my eyelashes. As liner, it needs a little dry time or it will smudge, and as mascara it its thick when worn over regular mascara.<br />The real problem is that both the glitter and eyeshadow are sticky until dry, and they both, especially the eyeshadow, take a bit to dry. The eyeshadow is also difficult to blend, but I suspect it would be much easier to blend with another creme eyeshadow than the compacted powder eyeshadow I used.<br />All in all, it is a good product, just a little difficult to work with."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","xo_diana08","Houston,TX",5,"I absolutely love this product. I want to buy every single one of them. I get so many compliments when I wear it. The glitter is liquid and dries so no messy glitter all over your face."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Sarah the Stripper","Portland,  OR",4,"I love the beautiful green color that lasts and lasts, and I get lots of compliments.  But it does not blend. At all. I have to apply dark brown and some black to blend it."

(steel spark is my favorite)"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Rabz","California",4,"I really like both ends. The metallic liquid can be used all over the lid for a really quick glam look. If you have hooded lids like me then just don't take it too close to the crease otherwise it will spread when you blink. It doesn't dry right away so you have time to work with it. The glitter works well on top of the metallic and can be used alone also. I haven't tried either as an eye liner yet."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Cactus","Pensacola, Fl",4,"I use this for colorguard performances. Very bold, and pigmented. Easy to use. Better wear with a primer underneath."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","1000cranes","Reno, NV",2,"The glitter was very chunky and hard to apply. The applicator for the glitter and the shimmer shadow was very big. It was hard to accurately place the glitter. I bought this to make a cool glitter line on top of my eyeliner. This is definitely not the right product for this endeavor. I returned it."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Plain Jane Turned Makeup Addict","Wisconsin",1,"I had been wanting to try this for a while. Finally bought the Green Glimmer one and the gold one. It stung my eyelids! Also, it just doesn't really stay put even when I use primer before-hand. I didn't care for how it looked either. Looked and felt like I was putting nail polish on my eyelids. I think I'll stick to powder eye shadows."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Just me, Yolonda","Newport News, VA",4,"The pigment was all that I was looking for; plus... I loved the over all look. The product was very wet and creased if I didn't wait for it to dry all of the way. Drying time was a bit long but well worth the wait."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Helena","Missouri",5,"This eyeshadow is easy to apply, and it lasts forever! I fell asleep with it on and it still looked as good as when I first put it on. I also have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes, but this stayed on every time!"
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Shell","Mobile Alabama",2,"I love new thing and I love sparkly things. The color is great. My biggest complaint is when it dries it pulls your skin so bad that it is uncomfortable. Definitely don't use as a liner. Only use on the lid. And you will still have glitter on you days later because glitter is impossible to get rid of."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Nakia","Columbus, OH",4,"It was highly pigmented but hard to blend. I wore it to homecoming and it held up well but after about 8 hours of wear it completely wore off"

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Allovertheface","Las Vegas",1,"I have this product in the green and purple. The green eye shadow part is not bad. The glitter part is horrible though. The glitter is in some sort of gel form. After applying my eyes felt stuck together. And it all flaked off all over the place. The purple one lacks pigment and it applies way more clear than it should. I have a similar product from a completely different brand and i really like it a lot. These Revlon eye shadows are a disappointment. The glitter is a sticky mess. Both parts never did dry down completely either."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Kells","Greensboro, NC",1,"This applies like my child's glitter glue, but quickly dries so that when you move (try to continue applying makeup), it cracks/ cakes up and starts to flake up. Its horrible! Don't waste your money!"

Gives a slight sparkle to your lids, but it's not over-the-top. I usually use it for night, but it's just as nice for day also. Goes on smooth and needs no blending. Great for the extra pizzaz."

The glitter is amazing the application is amazing! You will not be upset with this product! Pigmention is great! It dries on your lid, so it lasts pretty long.

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Heather Hills, harpist","Raleigh, NC",5,"I have worn this only once so far to try it out. I bought it for performances and other special occasions when I need high-impact color and a little glitz. In spite of my fair skin, I have difficulty finding eye shadow that shows up and stays put without collecting in the crease. I love how easily it paints on. It has a very smooth and shimmery finish even before you add the glitter. I also love that you can choose how much glitter to apply so you don't have to look like a fairy if you don't want to. I used a line of glitter above my lashes like eyeliner, and it had a beautiful effect. I have so far worn the peach prism color alone. I also purchased lilac luster but have not tried it yet. I do not see how it would be possible to blend this creamy paint-on eye shadow, but I am no expert. There may be a technique I just don't know. Do be careful with placement: since this paints on, it can have a bit of a hard edge, so it is important to be precise. Nonetheless, I love the product."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","Audrey","Fort Myers, FL",5,"These creme shadows are amazing! They dry down pretty quickly, so blending is almost impossible but they are crazy pigmented and do. not. move. I swear you can rub them as hard as you can and they don't move on your eyelid. They remove easily with makeup remover or wipes but they are so long lasting, it's hard to believe they're drugstore. And the glitter is amazing, too! The more gold glitters are much better than the darker colors, but all the glitters are also budge-proof. Seriously worth every penny!"

The cream eye shadow is easy to apply, but it doesn't stay on and you can feel it on your eyes even after it dries. The glitter liner is too gloopy and you have to apply too many coats to get the full glitter effect. Would not buy again."

The metallic side is great! Once it dries you cant put anything over it because it starts to flake, but it was very pigmented. I actually returned mine and I have been using the Urban Decay Metal Liners instead. Soooo worth the extra money!"

And for young users-a mature lid that is soft and with some wrinkles would be tugging and would feel heavy<br />Some glitter sparkle can trickle down the end of the eyes.<br />Stays put.

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","rissasaorous","okc,ok",4,"Overall the product is great - it truly is different than anything I've ever usesed. It's more of a nail polish for your eyes. The color side (I have the golden one) goes on beautifully - it also gives a nice cooling effect. Be sure you let it dry before opening your eyes completely or it will smudge! I like to do my lipstick while thats drying. As for the glitter - it was just okay. It's alot like applying glitter nail polish. You have to go over multiple times and really work wear you want the glitter to go. It smudged very easily and also comes off easily - which would be great...if it was only when you were trying to take it off. As for blending with shadows, its kind of difficult but not impossible. I just felt that it took me more product to get the desired effect of blending."

The glitter was difficult to apply evenly. I had to let it dry, apply more, let it dry, etc...... I had originally intended to buy all the colors so I will try it again, this time without a primer under it. It I don't get better results I'll be giving it away."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-eye-art?productId=xlsImpprod11851093","DonniPhilly","Philadelphia, PA USA",4,"I like this to wear under my eyes just below the water line. The applicators that come with it are not good for precision or for getting the right amount of product where you want it. I use a brush with a tiny bush head to apply this and it works much better.  I dab a little bit of product on the back of my hand, and dip my own brush in that.  It does dry quickly this way, so I only dab enough on my hand to do one eye at a time.  The product stays put all day, and doesn't settle into the little wrinkles under my eye.  Even eye or makeup primer settles into those wrinkles, so I just wear this and it doesn't move at all throughout the day."

You really have to play with it though until you get the process of putting it on down pat.  I also watched youtube tutorials with makeup artists to see how they put it on and their tips which really helped me.  The cream dries fast and the glitter stays tacky for a while so I had to tweak my makeup routine for it.  Other than learning how it works with my eyes, I love it!  It's fun.  I bought the gold/ topaz color."

I love a pop of it at the center of my lower lashline for a flashy eye look.<br /><br />The cream end, however, is impossible to blend, takes forever to dry, and it's sticky as heck, you'll be carefully peeling your mobile lid away from your upper lid all night if you don't give it forever to dry.

But if you don't take a little extra care, this is prone to flaking. I use a primer and a little black shadow to make the colors pop, and I make sure to let the creme shadow fully dry with my eyes closed.<br /><br />If I apply it without a base or without letting it dry, then it starts cracking within two or three hours. When I apply after primer and powder base, it lasts until I take it off. I've gone more than twelve hours of perfect wear, and it doesn't require touching up if you apply it properly the first time around. The glitter liner makes for a great pop of color--again, let it dry!--and I like being able to use it over powdered shadows."

It does not crease or smudge and lasts all day. I like to use a darker blending shade from my naked 2 pallette in my crease and then I apply the base coat to lid and while still wet, blend out with finger.
