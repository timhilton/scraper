"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","So Sunny Sue","Austin, TX",1,"Just difficult to use and once it was on, didn't stay, so a lot of work for no return.  Which, speaking of, I should have just returned it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Multi-tasking mum","New Jersey",4,"Eyeliner is really nice but the product starts drying iut once opened for use..and the clumpy texture is difficult to remove from brush"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Kat","Columbus, OH",4,"I wear this product on hot and humid Ohio summer days, and it absolutely does not smudge or run. In other words, no raccoon eyes!  I had sworn off all eyeliner (even the high end brands) due to the fact that they all run (and because my eyelids get oily), but this eyeliner absolutely stays put even in muggy midwestern weather.  Thank you Revlon!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Immy","Tyler, TX",5,"I bought this in charcoal and my sister promptly went out and bought her own in jet black. I wear a bunch of colors with mine whereas she uses the Naked palette from Urban Decay, and it goes great with both styles. It's very easy to apply and doesn't run, even when my pinewood allergies are acting up. It's cheap enough that it's not a big loss on your pocket book if you're experimenting with something other than a pencil for the first time. I do recommend this one."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Stephanie O","Santa Rosa, CA",4,"Bought this as my first gel eyeliner ever, mainly because they were out of the Revlon ColorStay Liquid Eyeliner (which is phenomonal BeeTeaDubs) I'm Pleased to say the least, like this product for lower lid, not on top though :/"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","adslkf","Atlanta, GA",1,"Although I havent tried very many eyeliner but i can tell this gel eyeliner is the worst one by far. It fades and never sets. It also smudges a lot when worn even for a short period of time."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Lauren","Ashburn, Virginia",5,"I do not wear much make up but I always line the top rim of my eyelids to make my eyelashes look fuller. I have been searching for a long-lasting eyeliner that is easy to apply but also easy to take off when I screw up. This is it! Revlon Colorstay has the perfect balance of permanent but fixable.<br />The amount in the jar lasts a long time so you really get a lot for what you purchase. The creme goes on very smoothly. It is a little bit more difficult to draw thin lines because of the brush design. <br />One reviewer complained that if you try to add multiple coats the second coat rubs off the first. From my experience as long as you wait for the first coat to dry you should not have problems adding multiple layers of this eyeliner.<br />This eyeliner lasts all day for me. I use the charcoal color. It has a bit of a shimmer to it, especially when you are outside. When I surf or swim my friends always ask how my eyeliner is still perfect. It doesn't smudge or run in the heat either. <br /><br />Thank you Revlon for making a product that actually stays on for a long time!!!!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Alyssa","Portland, OR",3,"I like the form; having the brush built in to the bottle was convenient. I also like that you can get a soft smudgy look or a more defined look, and this liner will not run away unless you accidentally touch it. BUT it quickly got kind of thick and pasty and though I still wear it, its hard to get it to go on evenly. Its clumpy but also not darkly pigmented enough, so I get dark blobs and then light spots that I have to go back over three times. I wish there was more pigment and a little bit thinner consistency. I am going to try a different brand next time."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Wandella","Altoona. pa",2,"Didn't go on as easy as I expected. I guess the word &quot;gel&quot; does not mean  &quot;glides &quot; on.  Was trying to stay away from tugging with a pencil but the gel was worse"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Joan","Las Vegas",1,"Didn't go on like any eyeliner I had ever used. Wanted that color, but the store I usually go to did not carry the Revlon Skinny Liquid Eyeliner."

I was leery about using a gel, but it's easy to apply to my 50+ eyelids, so it's &quot;easy on the eyes&quot; :)"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","MsPaLa","Brooklyn NY",1,"Unfortunately this did not work for me. I noticed during the day I had one winged eye the other had completely come off. It faded quickly. The applicator brush was a little complicated for me at first. Will not repurchase"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","kate","Ohio",3,"I have super oily eyelids and all other gel eyeliners I've used transfer onto the top of my eye. So I picked this up since I've used other color stay products that worked really well. This product doesn't transfer, but it's absolutely impossible to get on. I don't like the brush that comes with it either. But regardless of the brush I use to apply it, it just won't go on."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","E","Anchorage, AK",5,"LOVE love love this product. Only bad thing about it was that I did not like the brush. Used my own small angle brush to apply the eyeliner"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Mar","Houston, Texas",2,"I tried this product when I ran out of the eye gel I use. I really like it, however, not stays on throughout the day and it runs."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Turnthetables2","Coon Rapids, MN.",5,"It goes on and dries nicely but needs to be reapplied later in the day.  It's the best I've found so far."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Haneul","San Diego, California",4,"I mean the pigmentation of the eyeliner definitely isn't the best, but the fact that it actually lasts all day on my eye, whether I am sweating, crying, oiling, or any other thing, makes it so awesome. I love that I never have to  check the mirror throughout the day because I know it wouldn't smudge under eye, or on the crease. Recommend for people who have no time to correct makeup throughout the day!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Ggurl","Tampa, FL",2,"I purchased this product with my own money. I was very disappointed to find that this product did not deliver with the pigment I was hoping for. Sure, it's a drugstore brand, but like I said - I was hoping for more! It glides on nicely, stays put in general(especially with eyeshadow base), but it is not a true black; rather, it is more of a watered down black color. It reminds me of painting with black watercolor, which isn't my style. I have noticed this makes for a nice eyeshadow base to apply black shadow on top of or another shadow that you want to make look darker. Otherwise, this is going into my &quot;meh&quot; makeup pile! Would not purchase again."

This stufff is amazing.  It doesn't budge, smudge or travel.  I put it on before work in the morning and it's still exactly how I drew it at night when I go to take off my makeup.  The colors are rich and true and it goes on very smooth.  I have nothing negative to say about this product.  Try it, you will love it!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Sxysadie","North Port, FL",1,"this product was dried out when I opened it! and the opening for the jar was so small I could barely fit my brush in it.  Tho, they do provide you with a brush, those ones are never any good, so I didnt even use it. FAIL"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","beautybiz","PA",4,"Overall, pretty pleased with this--the applicator is a smart idea, because you'll never lose the brush again. Glides on nicely, but as w/all eyeliner like this, you need a steady hand. The black can look a little harsh for daytime."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","lormj","San Diego, CA",3,"I thought this would be a fine point thin brush to draw a line close to the lash line - I have heard a lot about gel liner and was hoping to achieve that effect- unfortunately the brush is kind of thick so it is very difficult to create a slim straight line... you get more of a thick line that you could smudge easily for a smoky look if you do it quickly, after a minute it sets and stays put relatively well. But the brush is just too thick- was hard to create even lines that matched both eyes too."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","kaelint","Fort Worth, Texas",4,"I like the color on this product really well. I have green eyes and it really brings out the color without making it too dramatic. My only complaint is it doesn't last all day (but what product REALLY does?) and the applicator is a little thick, makes it hard to define any lines. But the actual cr&egrave;me is good."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Hurricaned","Orlando",4,"Some gel products come with separate applicator, like  we need more stuff to look for in our purse or bathroom!

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","5280 Girl","Denver, Co.",2,"I have to say that this is by far one of the worst gel eyeliners I have ever used. The gel is easy to apply at first but if u need to add more product to make it thicker or darker, it will just fade the gel that you've already placed. The color is not very dark and it runs or fades very quickly. Once I place it, I leave it for a few and then try to curl my lashes, it completely removes the gel. I've used primer, makeup setting spray, and concealer- this product just refuses to last. AWFUL product that I will never buy again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","preciosa","il",2,"This was my second gel liner I purchased . Previously had tried ELF and the quality between that and this one is not much different.  I purchased black and its not as dark as I would like it. It applies &quot;ok&quot; but to me fades throughout the day. You get what you pay for, ill stick with a liquid liner."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Indigo Rose","Denver, Co.",1,"I bought this gel eyeliner to try something new. I've used gel eyeliners before and never had an issue. This one just happened to be on sale and claims it lasts for 24 hours. This is probably the worst eyeliner I have ever used. The bottle and applicator are neat, the formula applies easily and is easy to put on. However, this stuff doesn't last. I use a concealer base and it smeared. I used an eyelid primer and it smeared. I used a makeup setter and it smeared. It doesn't even last half an hour and its almost gone. ESPECIALLY if you curl your eyelashes or use anything near the eyeliner that would brush against it. Hard to believe since it claims its also water proof! I've used dollar store stuff that lasted longer. This is definitely getting returned."

You can workout and sweat, cry, and even get caught in the rain and the color stays on. It doesn't glide on as easily as some pencils but after you use it a while, you'll get used to applying it."

I wouldnt say that this is exactly the same, but its far closer than others that I have tried and a bit cheaper than what I was paying for clinique products!

I'd look in the mirror and I would see black smudges under my eyes where there wasn't eyeliner . I read a review about Gel Eyeliner and tried this and I LOVE IT!  Does not smudge or run during the day.  It doesn't last all day, sometimes I have to reapply and it does take me longer to apply in the morning but...its worth the time to not have to worry about &quot;looks like she went out drinking and didn't wash her face&quot; look!  :)"

Instead of the brush it comes with I use an angled liner brush which makes the outcome look even better and easier to control! Not hard to make a thin classic line or a thick dramatic line!"

The brush is too thick to make a thin line and the gel liner isn't really dark enough for a liner.  It works okay as a dark eye shadow - but that's not what I bought it for.  Also, it is not hypo-allergenic.  It gave me a rash on my eyelids."

If I apply two coats, my eyeliner will stay in tact all night, even over a day sometimes, though don't go for that! I get asked how my eyeliner is still perfectly on all the time. I recommend periodically wiping the little brush with toilet paper to keep it fresh."

I set my eyeliner with black eyeshadow to add more color where its needed to make the eyeliner pop. This is my go to eyeliner and i highly recommend this."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Alyssa","Portland, OR",2,"It's clumpy, but also doesn't have enough pigment, so you get dark blobs and then light spots that you need to go back over several times. <br />Kinda like when you are using a dry erase marker that is running out of ink and you go back over your line to darken it but it sort of erases itself so you go back over it again and now you have a patchy mess."

I need something that glides on better.  I love the feel and look of this product, but after a few hours, I have smudges and sparkle flecks under my eyes.  I will be conducting experiments to ensure that I'm not misusing the product, so don't let me dissuade you.  Like I said, I love how the product glides on, the applicator brush is soft but defines well, and the color is oh so pretty!"

I was always scared to try this kind thinking I wouldn't have a steady enough hand but it was surprisingly super easy to apply. Glides on easy, dries instantly and stays put all day. Went out and bought another color immediately after trying and this is my go to liner from now on. Also love how you can wear it thick or thin depending on your mood. Very versatile."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Carol the Perfectionist","Cherry Hill, NJ",4,"This eyeliner definitely gives me a more defined makeup look.  It is dark enough to accent my eyelids.  It went on smoothly and easily.  If I put a bit too much on the brush, it came on too thick so I have to put less on the brush to get a thin line look.  Since it's waterproof, it stays on very well but it's difficult to remove even with the eye makeup remover lotion I use."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-creme-gel-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod3820339","Sandgirl","New Mexico",1,"I like the purple color, but this eyeliner has so much glitter in it that it will get all over your face as soon as you put a tiny bit of eyeliner on your eye. It is very hard to remove because of the glitter, too. <br /><br />The packaging is horrible, too, very difficult to open and use the first time, for no good reason. <br /><br />This was a huge disappointment. If they had left out the giant chunks of glitter, I think I would be a fan for the price. However, since I never want to look like a Christmas ornament, this is a product I do not recommend [unless looking like a glittering Christmas ornament is your thing...]."

It is really soft in the bottle, so you don't have to use much pressure with the brush to load it.  Good color and lasted all day."

Everyone looking to create a thinner line, just buy your own brush :) I've worn this eyeliner all day, fallen asleep in it and it still looks like it was just applied. No smudging/running, nothing. I've even taken a shower with it on, still looks PERFECT! But surprisingly it's not a pain to get off, I don't even use make up remover. Seriously my holy grail eyeliner."

I swap between this and Benefit they're real eyeliner. Depending on the type of line I want. I found to avoid clumps/dry out you have to do some up keep. Clean brush after each use and mix the gel before using. The only downside is after a long day (usually I wear mine for 10+ hrs) the outer corners crease a little. To avoid this I have touched up before going out for the evening."

The tip of the liner tool was too thick. I have large eyes and relatively normal sized lids, however the clumping/inconsistency of the product and application brush were not a great match."
