The color looks super pretty in the packaging but I couldn't get it to work on my face. I didn't get any color payoff and it just left shimmers behind. The stick also tried to wipe away my foundation underneath as I tried to apply it. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/insta-blush?productId=xlsImpprod15361021","TamBam","Michigan",4,"I have olive color skin and was looking for a natural blush stick that would blend easily and stay on.  This was more pigmented than expected but still blended very nicely just using my fingers.  The color read a little more pink on me than what it looked like in the tube but still gave a nice overall healthy flush.<br /><br />I would purchase this and recommend it to a friend as it's high quality for a lower price point.  One star deducted for its total wear time which was not as long as I would have liked.  I have normal skin type and it disappeared on me about 3-4 hours later with no activity.<br /><br />&quot;This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I was unsure about this product as I have not had  good luck with blush sticks in the past. However I was so pleasantly surprised with this blush. Nude Kiss looks darker in the tube than it actually is so don't be afraid ladies.  The color is buildable so I can use it to contour and as a traditional blush making my colors seamless all while blending beautifully.

I did pat on some pink powder blush which gave me my perfect color. I would say, this blush is easy to carry in your purse and can be applied for an instant pop of color anytime, anywhere.

However, it appears like a nice bronzer on my skin but I can hardly notice it so i had to really build it up. Good thing it's really blendable or else it looks clumpy if you rub too much of it or if you're using a liquid foundation. I love the concept though because it's so convenient to use I'd rather get a darker shade in the future. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I was never really that good at applying powder blush, but Revlon Insta-Blush is so easy to use.  This blush is practically fool-proof!  I just apply my foundation like I normally would and then just add a few swipes of this blush and blend.  You can repeat as many times as you need to achieve the color that is just right.

"http://www.ulta.com/insta-blush?productId=xlsImpprod15361021","lasirenita79","Palmdale, CA",3,"I tried to like this blush, the color looked so pretty in the tube. I don't know if my skin is too dry, but the formula seemed to have a chalky texture and would clump when I tried to put it on. Also, because the formula is sheer, I had to use a large amount just to be able to see the color on my cheeks and I really disliked the smell. It smelled like old, rancid makeup (maybe it was defective?). Anyways, perhaps this product would be better suited for a extremely fair person (at least this particular shade) with normal to oily skin, because it didn't work for me.<br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

However I did use the Revlon Insta-blush Candy Kiss and with a bit of patience I applied it without smearing my foundation. I love the pop of fresh color it gave my cheeks! Very natural. I also tried it as lipstick and eyeshadow. Bit thick for lipstick but after some practice and lip exfoliation it worked well with clear gloss to finish. It is definitely a great product!#sponsored#gotitfree"

I love trying new products and shades but, I was a little nervous about the Nude Kiss blush as I had never tried or used such a dark toned blush. I have a light skin tone and was afraid that this blush would make me look silly. Boy was I wrong! This blush looks amazing on my skin and wasn't too dark at all! It's easy to use and apply, and the stick applicator allows you to apply exactly where you want. This blush goes on smoothly and blends amazingly for a flawless glow! One of my favorite things about this blush is that it lasts all day long and doesn't wear off! This is great for all of those who don't have the time to reapply makeup throughout the day. I would love to try all the other beautiful and pigmented shades, as I am sure that they would look amazing as well! I'd definitely reccomend this blush to everyone looking to step up their makeup game and those who want an amazing glow!

"http://www.ulta.com/insta-blush?productId=xlsImpprod15361021","Kari","Michigan",4,"I was worried the Nude Kiss shade would be too dark for my very very VERY fair skin, but it was easy to blend with either a brush or the pad of a finger and looked natural once blended fully. My main problem with it is I had to apply a thick streak across my cheeks before blending, and therefore couldn't really just swipe across the areas I wanted like I would with a powder blush. I had to apply this blush, blend, and then see which areas could use more color once it was blended, apply more, blend, and so on. I didn't want to risk applying too much and have it look much darker than intended. Maybe the lighter shades of the Insta-blush don't have the same problem, I don't know. <br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

"http://www.ulta.com/insta-blush?productId=xlsImpprod15361021","Windstruck90","MN",4,"The Revlon Insta-Blush Candy Kiss is in a cream stick form. I am not really a fan of this because when you use the stick itself to apply directly on your face, it wipes away the foundation that you just applied. How I like to use it is I swipe a little bit on my finger tips and pat it on my cheeks. This helps keep my foundation on and it also helps me not go overboard with applying too much blush on. This shade is a brighter pink than what I would normally go for, but it is still wearable if you apply it lightly.

They blend nicely and lasted me a good amount of time (9am-3pm) without having to do any touch up. I'm normally pretty oily and these didn't slide off my face like others tend to do.

I also really liked the Candy Kiss color for my skin, it looked so natural on it!<br /><br />The only thing to be careful of was to not push so hard when applying, because chunks would come off and it was harder to blend those in.

I really like the color and I liked how the color looked on me.  It made me look radiant and refreshed.  I had never used a blush in this format before (I've always applied powder blush with a brush).  I found that it was more time-consuming to apply this product because it required many dabs per cheek and it took a while to get the blush in just the right areas and to get both cheeks evenly colored.  I didn't really need to blend the blush into the liquid foundation that was already on my skin.  By dabbing it on, it blended itself quite well.

This may actually be a multi-use product because I think it can also be used as a sheer highlighter as well.<br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

It's very smooth, almost like a powder after I applied it which is interesting because after I tried it I did read that it's a &quot;cream-to-powder formula&quot;, which I found to be true.<br />The pigmentation is medium, it gives what a more translucent finish which is what I want in a blush and it's very blendable. I could also see using the Rose Gold Kiss shade as a highlighter.<br />The packaging is nice with a clear top and twist-up design and it has a light clay scent that does not bother me.

It's a more subtle highlight, and if you want more brightness, it can be used as a base for a brighter one. But it applies in stripes, since it's a stick, and you have to blend out the edges with your fingers, a sponge or a stiff brush. If you like solid highlighters, then that's not a bad thing, but after using this, I can say I definitely prefer powder highlighters. They're just easier to diffuse."

I'm not sure if it's just the shade I received, but I found it hard to get much color to show up on my cheeks. It does leave a great light shimmer however, so I've actually been using it as a highlighter, which I really love. The blush seems like it will last a long time as you can use the dial at the bottom to push the blush stick up the tube and it seems to contain a lot of product. I'd like to try some of the other shades to see if they work better as a blush for me but I do really love the rose gold kiss as a highlight. Super pretty!

The color is light and natural looking. The blush is easy to apply and goes on smooth. It is great because you can blend it with a blender or your fingers when in a hurry. Another great thing is that it is small enough to go in a pocket or purse so it can be on the go. This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

So when I received this Revlon blush I was still a bit scared to try. When I actually did get around to using it I fell in love. The formula is smooth and it Glides on easily. It is not super dark, which some people may not like, but personally I was happy for that. It gave me the ability to layer until I got the desired color. I think it gives a natural flush look to your face which is good for an everyday look. I have dry skin and I liked the formula a lot. It didnt get cakey looking and was easy to blend in. If youre into super pigmentation, this blush probably isnt for you.  <br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I was disappointed when the brush removed most of the color from my cheeks. For my next use, I tried using my fingers to have more control over blending.

I would recommend this more for people who don't tend to wear foundation but more for those who like to wear a light, blendable blush and translucent powder for setting.  A primer is also very helpful to use with this blush or the longevity isn't very great.

The blush initially fell out of the stick into the sink but I am hoping this was an isolated incident. After placing it back inside, I found the blush itself very easy to use and it applied smoothly, without dragging and was very soft on the face. The blush was easy to blend, both with my fingers or a sponge but was very sheer. I applied several coats before I could really see it but after doing so it was very subtly beautiful. I really preferred using this stick to the normal powder blush that tends to be overly bright and sometimes clumpy. While the sheerness caused me to use more blush than normal, this wasn't a problem as it felt so soft and smooth and lasted for hours. I really enjoyed this blush overall."

It took a little bit for me to warm up to it as I had just received a blush in my Julep subscription kit, which was smoother and easier to glide on, but funny enough, over the next few weeks I found myself using the instablush more often then the Julep.  While it is a tad bit waxier, it has some serious stay put power!  The other one was too shiny (which kind of went against my shiny skin) This one was such a nice matte formulation it stayed put and even helped reduce shine!  My sister-in-law was going to take stuff I didn't want, I ended up giving her the Julep blush and keep this one for myself!  I want to try the Rose Gold one next, but yeah this takes a little getting used to because you do have to rub it on heavy at first before you blend it, but its such a nice formulation!"

I like that it is a nice light pink color and matches my skin tone nicely . It does stay on your cheeks for some time and is pigmentated. I kinda wish it had more pigmentation and showed more color .

The product looked like a great shade of pink, but when I applied it to my cheeks it gave me more of a gold glow with very little pink pigment.  I like how smooth the product was going on my face and it had a dry touch, no oily feeling.  However I would not purchase this color for cheek color.  I would only use this as a highlighter."

I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.<br />The blush is in a stick format, similar to lipstick. You turn the base to raise it up as you use it.<br />Nude Kiss is a brownish tan color.  When I applied it directly to my skin, it was very dark on my light skin tone.  It wasn't so instant for me, since I had to blend it into my skin so it would look lighter. <br />But it works well and does its job for the most park.  I would love to try out other colors the might look nicer with my skin tone.<br />The only other thing I have to say is that the stick of blush easily slides all the way out of the container, so you have to be careful not to open it fast and have it go flying across the room.  That would be messy.  I would be worried about just throwing this in my purse, and I wouldn't want the lid to get loose and the stick to fall out onto my stuff."

"http://www.ulta.com/insta-blush?productId=xlsImpprod15361021","Jaqinator","New York",3,"Candy Kiss is a very sheer, but natural, looking blush.  It's like a very light baby pink. Like cotton candy. At first, I was a bit iffy about it, for the stick broke off in half, and when I applied it, there were uneven chunks all around.  When you're applying it, it's VERY dry and cakey looking. Once I blended it out with a sponge, it was more smooth.  It is buildable, but layering down too much will end up having pieces of it just randomly laying down on your skin.  Not a good look.  <br /><br />I think if the formula was tweaked a bit, it would be pretty great. Afterall, the color is very nice, and matches my pale skin tone. Doesn't make me look like a clown or tomato. <br /><br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review."

I use the stick to dab spots of blush along my cheekbone and then quickly blend it all in with a damp blending sponge. You could also use your fingers to blend the product along your cheeks. One layer is enough for if I am just going to the store and want a flush of color. Two layers of color is perfect for blending with foundation makeup or for a night out. I feel like using a cream blush on top of liquid foundation and then finished with a setting powder is the ultimate way to find a natural looking glow from within.

I have previous experience with this line of product but in a different shade of color. I have to say this is absolutely gorgeous! Its a sheer pink with some shimmer. Its so soft to the touch and so easy to blend with just my fingers. The shimmer is not too intense, just enough to catch natural light to give a nice glow. Its the perfect shade for all day wear.

I like how easy it is to apply and how soft it is. It goes on smooth too and isn't too bright but a light pink that I like verses a bright red. You can apply more if you would like a more darker look, but I like starting off light. It is also easy to take off too if too much is used.
