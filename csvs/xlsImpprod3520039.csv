These stay on and help keep your lipstick in the line without bleeding.<br />Love the nude color for everyday basic color."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Blondie","Brunswick, GA",5,"I love this product, and have been using it for years.  I do have a difficult time finding the color &quot;Brown&quot; which I prefer.  I use a light to medium shade of pink mauve gloss as a lip filler, and love the look.  I have tried other lip liners, but they are too thick, too dark, too soft and don't work as well.  This liner helps to keep your lip's shape and keeps your gloss from feathering."

I love it so much that I will pay almost anything for it and stock up with as many as I can find in the store. I always worry they might discontinue it.

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","GrammyD","Ronkonkoma, NY",4,"I like that this product lasts. The convenient attached sharpener ensures you get a precision line. It enhances the shape of my lips, especially now that mine are shrinking at my ripe age LOL. I only wish the shade were darker...there used to be a darker shade that I liked &quot;Vixen&quot;. I would also prefer it to be a little creamier."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","JJ","Piedmont, SD",5,"This is my second purchase...as noted in my survey, I like all aspects of the product.  My one wish would be that it would be an actual pencil instead of the mechanical pencil.  Not near enough product in the mechanical pencil and I can't tell when it is close to being used up."

I just wish they offered a pinky- nude...which is my favorite liner color. The lighter colors in the line do not well on my skin tone. My favorite is nude which is a brownish color. The little built in sharpener comes in very handy too!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Grace","Doylestown, PA",2,"I'm on the hunt for a great lip liner in a very specific shade. I ordered this one online, figuring that the shade &quot;natural&quot; would probably work for me. In reality, it's more of a sparkly pink and looks horrible on me. The formula is dry and the liner breaks easily if you aren't careful. This one might be a miss compared to other shades in the range, but I don't plan to spend my money trying them out."

This lip liner is my go to- great color selection, easy to apply, easy to remove, and doesn't dry out!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Andrea","Tennessee",2,"This lipliner emphasizes all the lines in your lips and makes them look truly dry. It drags on the lips and is extremely difficult to apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Ann","Las Vegas, NV",5,"I have light brown/olive skin and this is the perfect neutral shade for me. Not too pink and not too brown. I have bought it over and over and over and over again! It is my number one go-to everyday liner. It stays on a long time, but is a little dry. I think it pairs very well with the Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in Brazilian Tan."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Caregiver Carol","Traverse City, MI",5,"Colorstay Lip Liner glides on easily.  I doesn't smear like some other brands do, and it stays on for many hours.  There are great color choices, but natural is my favorite.  It prevents my lipstick from feathering without being an obvious outline.  The pencils are generous, too.  They last a long time even with daily use."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","E","Westminster, CA",1,"I have always used Revlon products. But lately the eye and pencil liners are dry and break before I even have to twist up! I tried putting the &quot;stick&quot; back into the applicator but it never works right. Not convenient to return so I am stuck. Twice is enough for me."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","MN","Oakdale, MN",3,"This is one of the only lip liners I own. It's a simple color and matches really well with my nude lipsticks."

But now I'm looking for ways to incorporate this product into my everyday life. In the past, I always had to re-apply several time over a short period of time. With this product When I checked, I found I didn't have the need to!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Missyhardt","Olympia, WA",1,"I was not impressed with this liner.  It doesn't go on very smoothly and the tip crumbled off the first time I used it. The color on the cap looked to be a matte nude, but it's actually a shimmery shade.  The only plus was that once I got it on it seemed to last well."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Sarah J","Virginia",4,"I really can't decide if I like it or not. Some days it works great for me, others not so much. Good days it covers nicely, goes on smoothly and easily, stays put and prevents bleed. Other days it makes my lips look strangely chapped and sparkly orange- not really what I was going for."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Mermaids_tear","Inland empir, ca",5,"I am fair- medium neutral skin tone, this shade was my exact lip color. It was totally invisible on my mouth. That's actually what I WANTED  to go with my lipglosses. I HAVE UNEVEN LIPS, and this product helped correct the problem without looking like I have overdrawn lip liner. I love it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","Ro","New jersey",3,"This lip liner is ok. Not creamy enough for me. Tugs at lip when applying."

Just recently purchased a nice wine-colored red lipstick and this lipliner complements it well. It is also not too dramatic of a color so it fits with my skin color."

And of coarse I put my favorite lipstick over it.. I could sleep in it and eat a full meal and it's still on !!! I always use the nude one and every color lipstick looks good over it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-lip-liner?productId=xlsImpprod3520039","moshi","Milwaukee",4,"Great product for a little price.  The telescoping pencil is good packaging.  In fact I think this may be the same packaging style that Bare Escentuals used when they had a group of lip liners I also liked.  Since they don't make their product any longer, this is a good transition and no messy sharpening required!"

It doesn't stay on very long at all.  <br />I use this as a base, then put a nude-pink liner over it, then lipstick or gloss, which makes it useable."

I would not change for all the tea in China.     I am an older lady that had lipstick that would bleed out of my lip-line,  I am blessed to have found this.    I use the NUDE, the price is pretty darn good.<br />    I must add to this, that I also use the eye-liner as well, it is the BEST........I wear the Brown......again you could not get me to change.<br />    By the way I used to work in a high priced department store in Cosmetics...........selling all those overpriced cosmetics......here's a laugh.......I never used them, would go to a Drugstore and buy my Revlon.

Also, would like to have an automatic point without having to sharpen but I will settle for this product as it has done well for me for over 3 years."

Poor color selection means I can't use it by itself, and if the lipstick color is close, it's a good liner.  It helps keep the color from bleeding.<br />I recently returned one to exchange it for another because the applicator had tiny slivers of sharp plastic that were as long as the liner itself, and scratched my lips when I tried to apply it.  Just a cheap container, I guess. Wish there were more colors. Ulta had only two more liners, both a brown kind of color.  I like the coral and the sienna/ochre."

This happened 4 times consecutively until I was able to get a semi-decent application. I should add that I was applying it gently as well, out of the initial fear I WOULD break it! I tried it again a few hours later (maybe my hand was just too heavy, you know?) and no, it still broke.<br /><br />The color is beautiful and after I did get it on, it was very long-lasting, but the difficulty and mess in applying just turned me off."

Lipliners are meant to help hold lipstick in place for increased wear time and keep lipstick from sliding all over the place; that is exactly what this product does. it is not creamy/smeary, shimmery, or glossy in anyway and that is a good thing! As long as you don't wind it up to far it shouldn't break. It glides on smoothly and evenly with good color payoff. Definitely recommend, mauve and pink are my favorite."
