"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","KimP","Virginia Beach",3,"The Brush is good to get into the smaller lashes towards the nose side of the eye. But it did nothing for me as for the volume &amp; lengthening.  It did have a good solid black color. The first couple of days using it, seemed nice.  Then the last couple, it dried rather quickly and got crusty."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Shell","NJ",1,"The brush was extremely small which did not deliver even application at all. The product was sticky and trying to remove it took two days with two different makeup wipes."

I think it's the brush. It has stiff plastic bristles that are hard to clean off the excess and clumps. It made my lashes stick together and I couldn't get them to separate."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Ultaismyhappyplace","Mi",1,"The applicator was very small and it applied WAY too much mascara causing my lashes to clump together. It was difficult to remove with makeup removing towelettes and what was still stuck to my lashes then broke off and got in my eyes."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","V","Colorado Springs, Colorado",2,"Used it for daughters homecoming dance. She did not like the clumpiness. <br />The application brush was super tiny"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","SarahWantsGoodMascara","Dallas, TX",2,"The picture of the brush on the display is highly deceiving. I imagined a normal size rubber bristle brush, similar to their old colorstay 3D mascara, but was immediately shocked when I pulled the wand out and saw how tiny the brush is. The way it is shaped doesn't allow for excess product to be squeegeed off the brush before application, and the brush really doesn't have any substantial bristles so it just becomes a clumped mess. Once you finally get it on, I hope you love it cause it's never going to come off. Even with waterproof eye makeup remover, it's stuck like glue. You'll rip out multiple lashes and still have a coating of it on when you finally give up. I was trying to find something to replace my Benefit They're Real mascara and I'm starting to find out there may not be a close substitute."

Removing the clumpy mascara also removes eyelashes as it's all stuck together"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","wfm","nj",1,"I usually love Revlon mascara but this one was awful! The strange shape of the wand makes it difficult to apply the mascara nicely on lashes. This mascara also clumps the lashes and I had to use an old wand to separate them. I returned it and got a more traditional Revlon mascara"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Lookingglass17","Seattle, wa",1,"I ended up returning this product bc all it did was clump my lashes together."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Mira","Illinois",3,"The brush is very small and stiff. A larger brush with some flexibility would in my opinion work better."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Michelle","Sterling, IL",1,"It was clumpy and flakey. Very poor quality."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Mel","San Diego, CA",2,"It's okay...I guess.<br />Really clumps &amp; extremely hard to remove without your natural lashes coming off as well!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Jessy","Gastonia, NC",4,"I used this mascara this Sunday. It goes on smoothly. I like the brush and the bottle."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Sara Joy","Vestal, NY",4,"I use this at work and play. It lasts all day but is difficult to remove at night. That may be because I used Vaseline to remove it, so it may be operator error. It adds volume and length to my lashes and really makes them stand out. The brush is tiny but really gets at every lash."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","kel","irmo, sc",1,"application brush bristles are too short, lashes left looking clumpy and short.  this no matter the technique I used to apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","D","Portland",1,"I use it daily and strive for even mascara that coats all lashes, is waterproof and cleans off easy. This is waterproof, but sticks lashes together and is difficult to remove!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Shelbo","Vancouver, WA",4,"I love this mascara! It makes my long lashes curl and look even longer and adds volume. Only downside is, it's really hard to remove. I'll usually get off as much as I can with coconut oil then I have to use a wet rag and it's usually still some on. But when I wake up in the morning it's all gone so it's not too big of a deal"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Suzanne","Minneapolis, MN",1,"Very disappointed. Voluminous Carbon Black Volume Building Mascara does a much better job with length. The mini brush is a joke. Actually have this in my bag to return today."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Chris","Colma",1,"I use mascara daily. This product does not go on gracefully. It requires clean up after each application"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Kd","Olympia, Wa",3,"Bought this product while traveling and I couldn't get it off...slept in it and it looked like I had just put it on the next morning"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Kelly","New York",1,"I keep looking for a great mascara.  This one definately did not even come close.  The brush is so small I had to keep reapplying to make sure I got all my lashes.  It promoted volume, it had none.  The only thing is did was make my lashes dark.  It's more like a gel than your traditional mascara.  And trying to get it off, please!  I think I did more damage to my lashes trying to get it off!  I was still peeling off the &quot;gel&quot;  for a few days after.  I would not recommend this mascara and I will never buy it again."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Ash","Philadelphia PA",3,"Decent mascara, stays all day with no smudging or running. I can do a high intensity workout and doesn't budge"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","CG08","The South",5,"I bought this when looking to reduce the amount of money spent on makeup. I was buying various brands of $20+ mascara and it didn't work any better than anything else. This product beat them all. The brush is not my favorite, but the product itself more than makes up for it. It will also clump if you don't wipe off the tip of the brush and some on the sides too, but I think that's true of every mascara... The last conversation is also a plus- yes it's difficult to remove and it makes your lashes feel a bit like spikes, but I haven't noticed my lashes getting thinner or shorter and I've used it every day for over a month, so I don't care. That difficult to remove aspect means it not only lasts through my 9 hours at work, also my daily sweat session, and occasionally through the night when I forget to take it off. To get it off, you have to gently pull it off of your lashes since it forms tubes. I use makeup wipes- the oilier the better for getting tough makeup off. <br /><br />Two things sold me- first I can tell I have lashes for more than five minutes after applying and second my eyes don't start itching and watering the minute I apply it. I have long but straight and blonde eyelashes. Most mascara won't hold a curl- this one actually curls on it's own. I still curl them first anyway but it's nice when you're in a rush to know it's not required. I'm happy and will continue buying this product.<br /><br />Also, the only reason I have ever had it flake was because I was messing with my lashes while working. If I did that with anything else, it would have been gone completely. Maybe the reviewers saying it flaked for them just have a different body chemistry, but it's also possible they were playing with it. It is kind of weird feeling on your lashes since it's so stiff so it's easy to catch yourself messing with it."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Sierra","Olympia, WA",3,"For me, this was a waste of money. The brush is so small, that it's hard to use; it did not do anybting for my lashes, if anything they looked clumpy and short."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","MadzQ","Montana",5,"Stays on forever, love that one coat gives me long beautiful lashes.  Is harder to remove but I love that less lasts"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","Mel","Springfield, TN",1,"Hated this mascara. It has a super small brush and basically no bristles. It didn't apply evenly and it flaked terribly. Didn't last all day and was super had to remove."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-all-in-one-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14401009","First lady","Baytown,Tx",3,"No volume or length. Its basic"
