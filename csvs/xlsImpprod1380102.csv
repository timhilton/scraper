A friend suggested this one so I tried it and so far I am really liking it.  The color is long lasting with crumbling and it doesn't bleed.  The color is true to what it looks like in the tube.  Only problems so far is that it goes on pretty sticky, but it did not come with a gloss for over the top.  Solved that by adding some gloss I had on hand."

The shades I bought are nice, but the lipstick itself is just so horrible!  It gets very sticky right after application and after a few hours of wear, it starts getting clumpy and then starts sticking to your teeth."

Unfortunately, this goes on streaky, with bad color payoff. To top it off, it is sticky for the entire 2 minutes it takes to dry (shouldn't take that long!), and transfers to my teeth and then clumps on the inner lip quite obviously. Very disappointed."

However I found it to be incredibly  sticky and uncomfortably drying. After trying a couple of times my bestie said to try shaking it first. When I applied it after that it was much smoother, but still very drying and quickly became tacky. Not worth it and so disappointing."

It doesn't moisturize your lips.  When you apply it to your lips, it doesn't apply evenly, so sometimes you have to use your fingertips inorder to make the lipstick even- looking."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-liquid-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod1380102","Kimberly","oakland, ca",5,"It's glides on smoothly, then when it dries I put a clear gloss on top. Yeah like many say that it can be drying but that is an easy fix if you put a glossy lip balm/conditioner or lipgloss on top (wait til the color dry and set after 2 minutes of application); it will still stay on all day. Sometimes I even forget that it's on my lips because I wore it the whole day from morning to night it still stay to true color. Color will not rub off even when you eat, drink or kiss. It's a super lip color to me. I wish there were more color selection."

Tried too faced and tarte bcz they seemed to be the only &quot;professional&quot; brands that had long lasting. First off, those brands have limited color selection, and neither lasted long enough. I work with kids and have no time for primping and reapply. I returned both tarte and too faced, went back to loreal but decided to try this colorstay lip product. I love, love this color nude and also the iconic one. Both colors are so pretty on my lips!  They last over six hours, through lunch and disputing with teenagers. Goes on smooth, not a real need for using a gloss but I do occasionally for moisturizing. I highly recommend."

It was very sheer that I had to layer &amp; when I did it was an uneven application which made it look bad. I tried rubbing my lips together &amp; my god was it sticky! I began to remove it with a baby wipe as I do with other lipsticks and it was falling apart cuz it was soooo sticky. Hated it, &amp; returned it for my beloved Beso from Stila."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-liquid-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod1380102","Gracie","Carmel, Indiana",4,"I was so surprised at how well this actually stays on. It's sticky at first but once it dries it will stay on all day and night. The only problem is getting it all off if you do not wish to wear it the next day. You have to kind of scrub it off of your lips and it peels away dead skin but does not leave you sore. It's totally worth it especially for theater makeup or dinner because you will not have to reapply. It's also great because you can easily define the shape of your lips. It won't smudge later so define as much as you want! I love this product and have suggested it to many of my friends who have come to love it, too."

That said, these colors are really nice and it freaking STAYS. I have Royal Raisin and I love the color. I will also say that I have a similar product from Maybelline and I like Revlon's version much better. Maybelline's product didn't really wear away so much as the top lip took color from the bottom lip where they meet. So I had this weird crisp line where the color and stuck to the top lip, but the rest of it was fine.<br /><br />I like this product for a long lasting lip color, but it will dry your lips and accentuate lines. That's not a huge deal for me, but be aware before you buy this of what it is."

However, I've been on the lookout for a pretty, old Hollywood type red lipstick. Nothing I've found was perfect until I used this one in the color Top Tomato. It goes on like a gloss but turns matte pretty quickly. It feels dry (again, as I usually use Chapstick) but doesn't dry out my lips. I think it's a feeling you just get used to. I've already bought this for friends and told others about it. I'll definitely purchase this again."

I got it in the nude color, and paired with a slightly darker lip liner, this provides a great ombre look! Unfortunately, this gloss dries very quickly, and not just in a regular matte finish, but in a dry flaky finish. Whenever you reapply the gloss, you'll be reapplying it over a layer of dry flakes, so it doesn't look good. When you try to wipe it off, it comes off in patches, or sometimes not at all. I've seriously had to sit for 5 minutes straight just scrubbing at my lips for the stain to come off. Overall, I would say if you're going somewhere short term, wear it because it looks great. If you're going out for an entire night or a day at work or something, steer clear. It doesn't hold well. Also, either way, prepare to do some scrubbing to get the stain off!"

I have tried lipsticks, glosses, chapsticks with tint, and other stains to no avail. This baby really does the trick! But there is a knack to using it properly. Some reviews claim this clumps and/or dries your lips. Here's the trick I've learned over time with trial-and-error: I typically apply it during my morning makeup routine, applying it as the base coat to my dry lips (if they're wet/moist or have chapstick/anything on them, it won't last...it must be the base coat). Let the color dry once you're satisfied with the application (the more layers, the darker the color in most cases...1-2 layers is best, I find). Now, do not to rub your lips together while it's drying! It will cause the clumping and irritated/dry-feeling lips! Once dry, I apply a thin coat of lightweight chapstick I'm good to go for the day. And I only need to reapply color once throughout the day, if at all, as long as I keep my lips moisturized with chapstick, which I always keep on hand. The color is amazing and I love how it lasts all day. I have this in Premier Plum and Iconic Iris, which are both very true to the color the the bottle. Love. Hope this helps, ladies! Cheers!"

It is drying and makes my lips feel a little waxy.  Working your lips right after applying the product until it dries will prevent it from cracking or flaking.  I like the colors, but there isn't a wide selection.  The color doesn't bleed, so lip liner isn't needed. I do put a gloss on top which improves the finish and makes it feel less dry.  Make sure the product dries before applying a gloss topcoat. <br />You will need makeup remover to get the color off."

I'm satisfied with the color selection (I bought 4 different colors). The only colors I feel like the line is missing is more mauves and purples. If you do one layer evenly, it stays on great. If you layer it, you risk it clumping. It will stay over a lip plumper if applied a while after, but don't put plumper on top! When it does fade, it fades evenly."

I was really surprised by this product. The color really pops, and it truly is long lasting - even harder than most lipsticks to remove! I haven't had any troubles with it wearing off easily. I've found the best results when I use foundation on my lips first and then apply. The stickiness is temporary, from what I've experienced. The downside is that I've experienced some dryness from this product towards the later hours of wearing this product."

The tube lasts for ages and the color on the lips can go all day and through meals without a top up. Defnitely the best of its kind amongst similar products."

It's not very pigmented but it is buildable. Be aware that these are not matter at all (both of the ones I bought have glitter). Premium pink is a beautiful everyday pink color. It DEFINITELY does not stay on for 12 hours -- maybe 3 hours or until you eat. I probably wouldn't buy again.. I rather spend double the price and get a great product."

Unfortunately, it was not so.  The color both online and in person shows a light shimmer to the product when in fact the product dries to a very matte finish.  I loved how easy the application was and thought the product would remain glossy, but instead it dried after a minute and remained very tacky.  I felt the need to apply a moisturizing gloss or lip balm over the top.  While the pigmentation was pretty, it was not what I was looking for at all."

Comes in great colors for both warm and cool categories.  Need to apply it carefully because it does stay put.  When you apply something oily over it, such as lip balm, it can smear."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-liquid-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod1380102","Elle-pful","Houston, TX",3,"I really was interested in this because, having had tried the two step lasting lip products I found reapplication of the moisture side to be too much--so I thought this one step would be great.  I got this in Top Tomato.  It is a great saturated red, and when you first apply has a nice even application.<br /><br />However, if your lips are at all prone to drying this stuff will dry out your lips and the color stays all day, but will fade somewhat from the vibrant color to a more dull one over an eight hour day.  <br /><br />Overall I would say I liked the color a lot, but just like other long lasting products, you'd need a balm handy to prevent color flaking/ fading.<br /><br />My face wash takes the stuff off, but so will makeup remover pretty easily."

I actually couldn't get why there are bad reviews but I think it maybe coz of a couple of things that you have to know about these (1) they are sort of &quot;buildable&quot;- if you apply it very lightly, they go on almost sheer so definitely don't be afraid to just put on a bit of it :) This is a problem with something super natural however as they'll still look very light (2) After you put it on, let it dry (which it does super quickly)...after that, these just last all day pretty much. Mine last about 8-10 hours with eating, drinking- they don't come off easily. <br /><br />The color selection is great for work, going out etc. but sometimes I like wackier shades so what I do is apply the closest one as a base, let it dry, then wacky color on top.That way when the wacky color wears off (which it does after eating/drinking) I still needn't care coz these are there! <br /><br />Highly recommended-but remember: couple of coats and let it dry!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-ultimate-liquid-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod1380102","Belle","Dallas, tx",3,"I bought two of these: top tomato (050) and brilliant Bordeaux (040). The tomato is much brighter than it appears in the bottle, and the Bordeaux comes off almost as a deep mauve. Not true to color, but beautiful. The application takes some getting used to as it can tend to form a thicker &quot;liner&quot; coat around the edges if you don't wipe off most excess from the applicator. A little goes a long way, and it can get slippery fast. With practice, it's a cinch! Also, be warned that this never fully dries. What I mean is that it remains sticky the entire time you wear it. I've found putting a coat of Chapstick over solves the stickiness. The bad part: the Bordeaux lasts significantly less time than the tomato. I do not know why, but after multiple times wearing it for the same length of time and activity, the Bordeaux became crumbly and rubbed off the insides of my lips long before the tomato. I wore tomato for 9 hours, ate soup, drank from a straw, ate egg rolls, and only had to reapply once (and that was a thin coat just on the inside middle of my bottom lip). The Bordeaux, however, was slightly crumbly/clumpy about 2 hours after wearing it, and pretty much 2/3 off in about 3.5-that's with me drinking from a straw and eating chicken nuggets. I'm not sure why it doesn't last as long as the tomato, but I often find with lipsticks that certain colors just have a different formulation. I haven't tried the other colors, but my sister loves 070 and says it lasts all day. In conclusion, these can be amazing!!! But be aware that some colors might not perform as well. If you are only going to an event for 1-2 hours I don't think you'd have a problem with any of the colors. Everyone raves about the nyx liquid matte lipstick, and this blows it out of the water!!!! It also stayed on longer than the new $22 Anastasia lipstick. It's definitely the right choice if you don't want a drying stain. If you want to spend more, try the NARS lip pencils (cruella is beautiful). Hope this helps!"

To get even coverage you have to go over your lips twice then your lips become so STICKY it's gross.

I used it several times, with different top coats - cocoa butter, rosebud salve, Aquaphor, Vaseline - none of them worked.

However these liquid lipsticks are awful! They apply so streaky and patchy and it is one of those liquid lipsticks that if you apply more than one layer it will patch off the previous one. It also takes forever to dry down to a matte, and once it dries, it is so sticky. When I press my lips together, they will stick together like glue. I was so disappointed by this product because I think the color selection of these is so pretty."

It never budges and when it does fade a bit after eating, it fades evenly so I don't end up with clown outline on my lips. I have been able to wear these all day, through lunch AND dinner and lots of water and still had decent color on my lips by the end of my day.  I have this in four colors, Ultimate Orchid, Premium Pink, Miracle Mauve and Top Tomato. I find that if I let the lipstick dry fully for about five minutes, I can go in with an Eos lip balm on top to give my lips some hydration since I don't like a matte feel on my lips. Even when I forget to use the balm, I don't mind the feeling of this lipstick on my lips compared to others I've tried. For me this one is a winner."

My only complaint about Revlon Liquid Lipcolor is that it is pretty sheer.  For me, that's ok when the lip gloss stays moveable on my lips, but since this gloss dries, the color can look cracked if your lips are a little dry.

I have gone through many a phases in my life, grunge, tomboy, trendy, glam, natural ... but overall, I would consider myself somewhat low-maintenance. This is not to say I don't LOVE to dress up and look pretty and girlie, I've just never been one to primp and re-apply make-up throughout the day and carry around a mirror with me (I probably should ;) ... I've always worn mascara, foundation, blush, etc. But I've never been a lipstick girl, because I'm not the type to keep up with it. I do, however, LOVE the look of lipstick. This Top Tomato color is fantastic! It absolutely lasts all day (unless you eat or drink something oily/greasy). The color stays a beautiful, bright, True Red over the entire day (with maybe one fresher-upper). <br />Even though it has minute sparkles in it, it definitely has a matte finish. I still haven't figured a way to make it shine (without a gloss that removes some of the coverage). But it doesn't matter, I love it anyway!"

However, you kind of have to work at it with a waterproof makeup remover in order to get it off your lips if you use it on its own. If you use a gloss over top then it is a little easier to come off. The only thing I dont really like is that it is a little tacky after it dries, it reminds me of the back of a post-it note... also the smell is alittle odd. I would recommend this product with a gloss to go over it, then your lips will be able to slide around, not stick together."

There really isnt any smell, maybe slightly sweet if you're smelling the tube, but no scent after you apply. <br /><br />This lipstick is really really drying though. It settles in lines and is also very sticky. <br /><br />The first day, i just used the lipstick on its own and it was very uncomfortable, and started flaking off on the edges within an hour. <br /><br />the second day, i applied chapstick underneath, which helped lesson the stickiness, and kinda of helped the dryness, but still had to reapply chapstick every hour or so. I applied the lipstick around 7am and it started transferring (probably from the chapstick) around 11am and needed reapplication after lunch. <br /><br />It did last longer than normal lipcolor, but it is really dry and you still need chapstick on top of it. I will probably use it occasionally, but will not repurchase."

I bought Iconic Iris, which is a pale purplish color and it's sooo beautiful. It goes on very smooth and is not sticky. I'm not sure exactly how long the color lasts, but most shiny glosses don't last long anyways, so I wasn't expecting too much. I was not disappointed. I was looking for a paler violet that would tone down Mac's Heroine for a more summery color and this is it. Mac's lipsticks wear for an eternity and with this on top toning it down and adding shine is just marvelous! I will be looking to purchase more of these in the future. The only reason I didn't give it 5 &quot;lips&quot; or stars is because I think they could have made the pigmentation a little stronger."

It was the worst liquid lipstick I've ever tried. I literally felt like I had glue on my lips. It cause me to play with them and then it got patchy.

It stays on all day long through eating and drinking.  I absolutely hate reapplying lipstick.  I am the luckiest girl to have found this.  I use the nude color by itself mostly, which is beautiful, or if I want to change the color a little bit, use lip liner and smudge color forward.  Works like a charm.  I don't mind having to take it off before bed time with baby oil, because I know it completed its purpose of staying on my lips all day long without coming off.  I have used a lot of different products and this is the best one."

You have to put on 3-4 layers to get true opaque color. This is what makes it uncomfortable and sticky. Patchy. And frankly, too expensive for drugstore.  Love Revlon but this is a miss. Only pro: it does stain and last a long time if you are looking for that."

Also, if you rub your lips or purse them, it flakes off and leaves little bald patches of your bare lip everywhere.

It literally lasts about 5 minutes by itself, has no staying power at all. And it doesn't even nicely soak in and disappear like most cheap lip products do. It crumbles up and slowly peels off, leaving little blotches and balls of the products that you can't get off. Once you do get all of it off, your lips are dried out and chapped.<br />When you first apply it, it looks totally true to color and shiny and pretty, but within 30 seconds to a minute, it loses all shine, dries up, and becomes a darker color. After about 2 minutes, it starts crumbling off. <br />I unfortunately lost my receipt for this product, so this is going straight in the trash.<br />I usually like Revlon products, and this was a big surprise, especially for the price.
