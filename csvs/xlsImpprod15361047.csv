Very comfortable and color intense.  I plan to pick up a few more shades.  The tube is also so slim and small that it will work nicely in a purse."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Daydremes","NC",5,"I have been looking forever for a lip color that will moisturize and last on my lips.  I believe that I have finally found one!  Even after the lipstick has worn off, my lips feel smooth and moist, instead of dry and chapped. I got the color Dawn, and it was very pretty on my lips.  It has a very nice color payoff with just a little bit of frost.  I have fair  neutral skin, and it was a good choice. I will definitely buy this again and would recommend it to others."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Jules85","california",5,"If you were a fan of lip butters you will love these! There so pigmented in just 1 swipe, you don't have to sit there building the color. I picked up a lot of shades during the sale. My favorite shades are dawn which is a mauvey pinkish rose color, Twilight which is a dark purple basically but looks beautiful and is wearable for the fall/winter months, arabica is a dark burned brownish red color very unique hard to dupe I think it's gorgeous! Colors I was disappointed in was desert and Vineyard. Vineyard came off on my light medium warm skintone has a cranberry color would be great on fair skin looks washed out on my skintone. Desert I thought would be like a nudish color or lip peach parfait it was just not that pigmented and kina of a merky mlbb color on me not flattering at all. Lava is a bright orange red color perfect for summer and sunset was a darker coral color beautiful!  I also got the other brighter purple I love it! it's light a more brighter grape color and it's pulls purple on my nc30 _nc35 skintone. I can pull that shade off. There are very moisturizing and not drying at all! Plumps up your lips makes you feel and look amazing. I hope revlon keeps these around they did an awesome job with these. Now I'm not so upset about the discontinue of lip butters."

The shades are beautiful and richly pigmented, and they are super hydrating while still managing to maintain excellent wear time.  The scent is noticeable, but not overwhelming.  I love hem so much I now own every shade but 2..."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","CeeBiz90","Boston, MA",4,"Wow. I have this in Rhubarb and it is highly, HIGHLY pigmented. Once swipe gives full, glossy coverage and it's a truly gorgeous bright pink/almost red.<br /><br />The formula is interesting. It's a gel formula that kind of slides on and leaves a very glossy, plump and smooth finish. It might be a little tricky to apply because of this slippery consistency and because the lipstick doesn't come to a nice point. You might even want to line your lips first. This kind of lipstick makes me nervous because I worry it's going to slip around and end up where I don't want it. Particularly, I worry that it will smudge in the corners of my mouth because it's so slippery feeling. However, I've had very little problems with this. It stays fairly well where you put it, although it's not budgeproof by any means. <br /><br />This isn't meant to last forever. It's not transfer proof. If you kiss or eat it will def come right off very easily (watch those white shirts lol). However, it does stain the lips. I wish it wore off a bit more evenly. I tend to favor lipsticks that wear off very evenly, so even if it's not all there anymore, it still looks good. I haven't found a drugstore/affordable lipstick that wears off this way yet. This tends to wear off in the middle of the lips and can look a little worn and patchy. However, it layers well, so no problem re-applying, and boom, it looks fab again.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a fabulous, full coverage affordable lipstick with an absolutely beautiful glossy finish. Perfect for parties and nights out."

My lips are super dry so I love a moisturizing lipstick and this one is great. It has a tropical cocktail-type scent that, to me, isn't overwhelming at all. I have the shade Rhubarb, a beautiful classic red, and I want more!!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Billbec","Louisville",4,"Similar to lip butter"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","MelMar","Florida",4,"I'm always on the lookout for products that feel amazing (like nothing) on my lips, but look absolutely beautiful. I was intrigued when I saw the commercial for these. Gel gives the impression of lightweight while HD gives the impression of well high definition. I like to go to you tube to see reviews and swatches prior to purchasing. I was very nervous after most you tubers stated that the lipsticks had a very gross, very strong, artificially sweet pineapple scent that was rather off putting. I love fruity scents, but not if it smells fake and offensive. This may sound odd but when I couldn't smell anything through the packaging I figured it couldn't be that bad. Luckily I was right. I'm not thrilled with the scent, but it certainly isn't terrible by any means. Much more subtle than I expected. There was a slight tingling which surprised me a little bit. I personally dislike lip products that tingle, but it is extremely mild. This lipstick looks great on. The colors are very pretty. I purchased sand and desert. I am definitely going to get more and twilight is next on my list. Maybe rhubarb and dawn too. I thought desert would be more of a subtle wearable red, but I was so wrong. It's more of a pinky coral color which is fine just not as expected. All in all I think this product is great. It gets four out of five stars from me because of the tingling, very slight stickiness, and the scent."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Make up ranger","Oregon",5,"The product is excellent I just picked a color that doesn't compliment my skin tones so I will try again with a new color.  I love the way it goes on and stays on with minor touch ups."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Sasha","Clarksville, Tn",5,"Blends well with my natural lip color. It applies smooth and has a slight shine but too many layers feel sticky. I will be purchasing this again."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Sarah","Tennessee",4,"Great everyday lip. Doesn't last super long, but I think it is creamier than their balm and makes my lips feel great. I swipe it on a couple times throughout the day for a great color pick me up."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Liviaa","Papillion NE",4,"I really love these.  The colors are rich.  I do apply it often through the day because my lips are really dry.  These feel fantastic!  After a few applications, they do end up staining your lips which is nice, but I still like the glossy feeling so I apply often"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","WinterBaby89","Prescott Valley, AZ",5,"I love that this lippie is hydrating. It doesn't dry my lips out at all. The shape of it is great as it is smaller and more pointed than standard lipsticks. This makes it so much easier when applying to my peaked cupid's bow. It does have a fairly strong scent that you can smell when applying, but then it fades away. The smell doesn't bother me at all but I know it does a lot of people. I have fair cool toned skin and the shades Dawn, Tropical, and Garden look best on me."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Sandy","Midland, Texas",5,"I started with one but now have four different shades. First it goes on so nicely. And the colors are beautiful. It's a great formula. It has a certain amount of shine that gives your lips a healthy look. You can't go wrong with this product!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Roxiebean","Pittsburgh, PA",5,"These new lipsticks are the best!  I now have 7 colors, all beautiful. They are pigmented, moisturizing and just make the lips look gorgeous.  The color selection is so broad with nudes, pinks, reds and berries.  A few more trendy shades. Revlon got it right with this one.  Plus the packaging is beautiful. Streamlined and the color of the outside is the lipstick on the inside.  Love them!  The have a slight scent but not off putting.  I normally like unscented products but this one did not bother me."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","TJ","Aloha, Oregon",5,"These are stunning. I got 3 colors (Dawn, Vineyard and Twilight) and they are all so creamy and pigmented and beautiful. One swipe and it's fully opaque. They are very emollient and rich. I haven't tested for longevity but they are so nice, I'm already picking out more shades."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","DeeDee","Winter Park, FL",3,"I tried this product based on the great reviews.  I like the way it applies and looks on my lips, at least at first.  However, it wears off quickly, and tends to leave my lips feeling dry afterwards.  I do like that the product doesn't seem to &quot;bleed&quot; at all, but I am somewhat disappointed overall.  Probably won't purchase again,"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","AgMom","San Antonio, TX",1,"This is more of lip gloss.  After about 30 mins I had to reapply.  I was expecting it to last much longer than that.  The color is not very HD.  I use it as lip balm."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Chrissy","Rochester",5,"This was a YouTube made me buy it however I love this lip color. I have the color Desert. It smells fruity and it compliments my light to medium skin tone. I don't mind reapplying because it smells so good. This is a great everyday lip color"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Still Trying","El Paso, TX",4,"I have long lamented the discontinuation of Revlon Lip Butter and was thrilled to find this Ultra HD Gel at Ulta today. It's a perfect blend between lipstick and lipgloss. It's also very moisturizing for my fifty year old lips! It has a fruity, tropical smell which I like but I don't like the taste. It's not a strong taste or an overwhelmingly bad taste but I'd rather not taste my lipgloss at all (hence 4 stars instead of 5). The color &quot;Desert&quot; is almost exactly the same as Revlon Lip Butter &quot;Pink Truffle&quot;. It's a peachy pink color which is very neutral and goes with everything. I'll definitely try some of the other colors!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Cari","North Carolina",5,"This Rhubarb color is so pretty! I've always  been afraid of red lipstick, until this. It's like I ate a cherry popsicle! Yet, it has the light shine and teeny bit more opaque-ness. It's just gorgeous!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-gel-lipcolor?productId=xlsImpprod15361047","Cari","North Carolina",5,"I have the HD stains from Revlon and I ADORE them. When I saw these, I had to try. I got Sand and Rhubarb. Sand looks so beautiful over the London Posh stain! It's a golden nude with a pink undertone. Really beautiful, and it wears like a soft lipstick that has been blotted and hydrated. Perfect!"
