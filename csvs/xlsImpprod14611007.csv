The lipstick applies on creamy and is very moisturizing. It looks slightly matte but it really isn't. It needs touch ups after eating or drinking. The fruity smell is very strong when applying but wears off soon. While I like the smell, it might be overpowering to others. The cute container is a bonus!"

It looked like the perfect somewhat dark red but when I put it on it just washed out the rest of my face. I like these lipsticks though. They feel nice on my lips."

Looks like a classic red, but when you apply it too your lips it is exceptionally bright, not classic and does not look good with my skin tone.<br />Can I return it?<br />It may look great on someone with a different skin tone.<br />Of course, there was no sample available in the store so I couldn't try it first.  A sample would have allowed me to avoid this color and pick a better one for me.  Instead I just wasted money and I'm sitting here angry."

I applied it straight from the tube, and I won't do that again. Once it sets it's almost like a stain. I noticed it lasted all evening. That's good for me since I bite my lips horribly."

As I've aged I feel things need to be more defined and I like this color on me.  I am still not a fan of lipsticks as I think they require too much maintenance but as lipsticks go this one is good.  Also the price is doable.... I can't see paying $25.00 for a tube of Lipstick!"

Be aware that it has a strong scent to it also - I personally like it but I can see how it might put others off."

It's a beautiful shade of red, and I love how it's smells and tastes sweet. The smell may be a but overbearing to some, but this lipstick is gorgeous and completely worth it!  &quot;Love is On&quot; is my favorite! I also love the packaging!  &#9825;&#9825;"

The Super Lustrous formula feels great on your lips.  I have actually had multiple compliments on this lipstick.  Treat yourself to a tube!"
