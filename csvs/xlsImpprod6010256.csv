I'm middle-aged so matte lipsticks don't look as good on my lips. I need a little glossiness, so need to apply a clear gloss over this lip product in order to avoid aging my looks even more. It doesn't feel, dry but it looks it a little. I like the color I chose, Elusive. It lasts for a while, but of course eating a drinking removes it, so then it needs to be reapplied."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","AuntBee","Missouri",5,"This product looks great with light or heavy application. I've tried other colors in this line, but this is my favorite color. I have never liked dark lippies on myself, but this one looks amazing!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Leigh Anne","Clarksville, TN",4,"Compared to another lip crayon I've used, Revlon is much better. This went on smooth and had a minty (that's the only way I can describe it) scent instead of a nauseating wax smell of other brands. Only drawback is this color, ELUSIVE, is a lot brighter once it is put on than it looks in the tube. Not so bad that it is unwearable but go a little softer handed. This is the only color I have tried so far in their crayon/balm line but I will be trying more."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Edie","Colorado",5,"Have tried many lip sticks and this is my go-to, faithful lip color."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","ShoesOff","Coconut Creek, FL",5,"I love this lipstick.  I know they call it balm but I it isn't.  It goes on so smooth and looks amazing.  It has a matte finish which I love and the smell is very pleasant."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Linds","Dallas, TX",5,"I have an extensive lip stick collection, BUT THIS LIPSTICK is the one that I cannot stop reaching for!!! The color Sultry is absolutely gorgeous! I normally hate matte lipsticks as they leave my lips feeling both sticky and dry, but this lipstick almost feels like a moisturizer! It is truly my ride or die lipstick and I will keep repurchasing again and again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Alexa Leigh","Fort Worth, TX",2,"I returned this item, the color did not fully cover lips for longer than 20 minutes, the color also changed with drying to a webbed- almost transparent color. Showing through to your lip under the color, which I'd prefer my lips to look clean &amp; evenly applicators."

It is long lasting and goes on creamy. The shape makes application really easy as well. No complaints."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Laura","Morristown,TN",4,"I love the color, I have gotten complimented on my lipstick every time I have worn it <br />I wear it matte, or with a lipgloss over top.<br />I got it it 225 sultry"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Autumn Jynx","Lisbon, OH",4,"I have the colors &quot;Sultry&quot; and &quot;Elusive&quot;. I love them! They do need time to dry before drinking/eating, or the color will start wearing. I've found that after they dry down, they stick to your lips better. Being very matte, they can start to feel slightly drying after a couple hours. Also, they smell very minty and feel like a minty lip balm when applied; some people will like it, but some won't. I like it, though!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","ClassyChic","El Paso, TX",2,"I thought the consistency of this product was awful. It was true to color but was chalky and looked cheap on my lips- I'd go with another gloss or lipstick that isn't a crayon."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","makeupbymoira","Seattle, WA",5,"Oh my gosh! This line of products is amazing! I have the three or four shades and I love all of them! They last for hours and hours at a time! I can drink and eat and not worry about it coming off!! So much better than the high end lipsticks I have that have 30 minutes staying power and cannot last through anything!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Pearl","Houston, TX",5,"I highly recommend it, since the first time I used it it made my lips look matte an they felt soft plus I love the minty feeling it gives your lips which is great in the winter time to prevent cold sores."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Make-up Obsessed","Texas",5,"It lasted most of the day and didn't leave my lips feeling dry like other matte lipsticks. This is definitely one of my new favorites!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","mariemovies","Waldorf, MD",3,"It felt great when I first applied it. It went on smoothly and evenly. It did not come off while drinking or eating. It did make my lips feel and look dry about 1 hour in. In about 2.5 hours it was gone."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Liz","Texas",5,"Ok. I'm OBSESSED with this product. It isn't drying AT ALL despite being a matte balm. It smells faintly of peppermint, and it's super easy to apply. There's great range of colors for all different occasions! I wear this stuff on a daily basis. It's not the kind of matte that lasts forever, but when it wears down it looks like a stain. Since it's so easy to apply and carry with you, it's super simple to touch up! I can't recommend this enough!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Cate","Joplin, MO",4,"Gets a little clumpy after multiple applications... If I want to reapply I usually wipe the first layer off. That doesn't bother me, but I would just warn people not to expect it to last all day. Also, the container looks brown but the color is more of a deeper autumn-ish red (which is what I was going for)."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","n/a","Webster,NY",4,"Great for day or night."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","ms.mk","Ohio",4,"Good pigmentation, but is chalky and patchy so it works best after you smooth it out with your fingertip. Long lasting."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Beth the Lipstick Queen","Pinehurst, NC",5,"Not used to the minty flavor which kind of puckers your lips but love the look.  I like the matte finish and also is great with some gloss on top to change it a bit."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Barbie","Virginia",5,"I love make-up! So here is the real deal..... Shameless #215 is the closest dupe for Her*** since I can't say the name because it's screening the words... smh from MAC. Now the hue is slightly different with this being more of a blue based and MAC more of pink base. The color is so simiiar once applied its hard to tell the difference. The color is buildable and great for ombre lips! Def a must have!!!!! Go get one today, you won't regret it! :) Oh and it's matte but applies so smoothly you don't need to prime your lips."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Houston","Friendswood",5,"I love the Revlon matte balms they are highly pigmented and last a long time. They are better or as good as some of the high end matte lipsticks. The bast I have tried so far,I have tried many high end brands.<br />If you feel it a little too dry for your lips-- as all matte lipsticks are--  use a chap stick or a moisture lip balm first and then apply the Revlon matte Balm"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","ms.mk","Ohio",3,"I have this in a few colors. The colors are bright and opaque, and they're long lasting. However, they're chalky and cakey, and can be patchy in just one coat because of it. I have to pat them down with a tissue to get them to look even and smooth, but that's no big deal. I found them to be pretty matte--almost powdery and unreflective, and that powdery texture on the lips is why I give it three stars instead of four. I like that they're rich and solid enough that I don't need liner to make clean lines as well. Overall, they're okay."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Trish","St. Cloud, MN",4,"I like this lip balm.  I can't remember if it contains SPF, so I can't comment if it heals lips or has sun protection. It does go on very smooth and doesn't cake.  It does seem to be a little drying if not used with a lip primer or gloss.  The color is fun and I would continue to use this product."

I am also a big fan now, so I bought this shade last week. It is a gorgeous color, true to the tube. It lasts really long, doesn't dry out my lips to much, and even passed the kiss the boyfriend test more than once. A+"

I purchased the color &quot;Fierce&quot; perfect brown/berry color"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Shay","Chicago",5,"I thought I wouldn't like it because it said it was matte, but took a chance. I got every color. My favorite is shameless. They all have some moisture to them. Not your retro type of matte. I think it's better."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","allie","Tucson, AZ",1,"this is a good product but the color mischievous is horrible it sinks into all the lines in my lips and accentuates all the dry patches. I don't recommend this color."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","legallyheidi","Griffin, Ga.",5,"I have Elusive, and I plan on purchasing more. I am not a big fan of tinted lip balms, as they tend to fade quickly, or cake up. This is awesome, because it leaves a stain on the lips when it fades, however the stain isn't &quot;dry&quot; feeling as other stains. I also got a bit of a minty tingle from it."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Laila","Seattle, WA",4,"I have two of these and I have to say that they're just as nice as my matte lipsticks from MAC. In fact, they're more moisturizing than my MAC lipsticks. They come off if you eat something of course, but that happens with any non-long wear lip product. The only con I can think of for these would be that the color range isn't wider! I absolutely love the two colors I have, though."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Brittanyy","West Palm, Fl",4,"I use this product pretty lightly, sometimes with a balm under (personal obsession with lipbalms) because its extremely pigmented for my taste. I purchased in the shade Elusive and its a very pink, but not terribly bright. I think this can be worn on a day to day basis. Stays matte but i did not find it drying at all. Really creamy and easy to apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Jade, a fellow makeupaholic","Bushnell, Fl",5,"Growing up I have started to turn away from lip glosses because my hair gets stuck in it and I find it unflattering. Shiny, sparkly isn't my desired look anymore. These balms are highly pigmented, beautifully matte, slightly minty and they last pretty much all day when I use my Nyx lip primer underneath. I plan on buying the whole collection. Though I don't know when I'll wear purple, it's still a beautiful shade!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Lady Margaery","San Jose, CA",5,"This matte lipstain is AMAZING. I AM ADDICTED. The color is creamy, long lasting, and not drying at all! Sultry is my personal favorite for my olive skin tone. If you're on the fence, go buy one, I promise you will not be disappointed!!!!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","kittykat","petaluma, ca",5,"I love using this daily when i have no make up or am in a rush quick and easy to apply and can be stored in my purse."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","LoLo","Chicago, IL",4,"These surprised me because matte products always worry me that will be too drying but these are not drying at all. They are not moisturizing either but love the colors and are super pigmented. Plus can always top with gloss if want glossy look."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","MarissaGroovy","Wichita, KS",5,"I really love my revlon matte lip balms. Revlon has impressed me with this one- I had an idea they would be really translucent like most tinted lip balms (im more of a lipstick gal) but I was wrong! The color is intense and the pigmentation is pretty bright. It's nice having the color of lipstick and the comfort of a lip balm. I would buy them all if they came out with more colors!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","MaggieD143","Ft. Lauderdale, FL",5,"Love these Matte Balms. Got the color Standout and it's a gorgeous every day red. Highly Recommended."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","MNrnmommy","MN",3,"I am a very fair skinned brunette. I purchased Standout, which is a matte red.  It applies smoothly, and I like the control of color placement that this style of lip product provides. I have more of a cool undertone, and this shade worked for me. It was mint scented though, which I don't like. Now that I am in my mid thirties, I am finding I don't like matte finished lipsticks as much. However, if the fragrance doesn't bother you, and you looking for a matte lipstick to try, this may be a good one for you.   Ultimately, I returned it."

I hope they come out with more colors as well as more product so I can get my hands on them and review.

This does NOT dry out my lips, its like a beauty miracle! I love the minty smell and velvety feel... And the colors are stunning. I'm a redhead who looks best in warm lipsticks and a number of these look great with my skin tone. I'm so happy that I just bought another one (not on sale), tried it on, and haven't left the store parking lot yet! Just had to let everyone know about it!<br /><br />And to other redheads who may be looking for warm colors that match your hair, I bought Striking and Elusive. Love them both!<br /><br />:)"

This product is perfect for that! It doesn't go on very heavy and the Sultry color is a classic red/pink and suites my olive skin tone well. It's hydrating and lasts awhile - especially for a balm. If you're looking for a stain, this is not the right product, it will wear off after eating and drinking but it's great if you don't mind reapplying a couple of times throughout the day."

I have been looking for something matte but not the matte lipstick that feels dry. When I saw Matte Balm I was intrigued.  There was a great color selection and I went bright for spring/summer.

Mischievous would wash me out. It was too light for my skin tone but it went on nicely. Audacious goes perfectly with my skin tone but it settles into every line you have on your lips. Exfoliating is a must before applying this balm. It isn't long lasting. You need to reapply after eating/drinking. These two colors don't stain your lips but leave orange outlines and patches on your lips after eating/drinking. I wish the formula was better in these two colors was better. I did not try any of the other ones yet but will most likely do so in the future."

Shewy is a blue based pink so it almost has that Lilac color that is so on trend for summer plus you totally can't beat the price!

I have a light complexion, and all these colors look amazing on me. I have dark hair, light skintone .. Think mac nc30 .

On my lips the color is very pigmented, I have to rub it in my lips for a wash of color and then I apply a gloss over the top b/c it can be drying (yes, I know it's matte).  <br /><br />Perhaps a different color would be better but I don't feel I'd purchase another.

They are true to color, long lasting, and smell kind of minty. HOWEVER they are matte, so they can be very drying. I would not recommend this to someone with dry or chapped lips. Sometimes they can feather so it's very important to LINE YOUR LIPS FIRST! Overall it's a great product, as long as you have basic product and application knowledge."

It is not red like I expected, but a very subtle red which makes it very natural when applied on the lips. Aside from that, it has a very minty scent and cooling sensation which I actually like. The application applied evenly and smoothly. It is very matte indeed. The pigment is between light to medium coverage. So for those who wants a very pigmented red lip color, this is not for you."

I don't remember which color I got but it ended up looking neon pink on my skin even though it looked like a sort of soft, muted berry color from the tube. It was really bad and exaggerated all the texture on my lips (even though they were moisturized well and not chapped). I thought that I would like this since I LOVE Revlon's balm stains but this was just terrible. Skip it and go for something else to get the trendy matte finish."

Full disclosure: I've only tried the darker colors.  The lighter colors may be different.  But Shameless held up through talking, singing, drinking, and eating.  The gloss I was wearing wore off, and the color from this faded, but it faded evenly and beautifully, and not all that much.  Plus it feels like velvet.  It's non-drying, at least for me (and I have a problem with dry lips).  It goes on very smoothly and takes a few minutes to set.  Prior to setting I've found that it can be blended.  I like to use a lip brush around the outline of my mouth to neaten everything up."

I can wear it in the day or evening. I can wear it year round but it looks especially great in the fall and winter time. <br /><br />The downside is that it wears off fast. I went to Ulta in search of a similar color but that lasts longer. I spent over an hour trying to find the most similar color and finally found a similar one. It's Calvin Klein's one lipstick in color 230 entice. Almost identical in color and feel/way it goes on but a little higher quality and lasts longer. Just an FYI."

The lighter one doesn't have perfect color pay off, but it's something you have to be really looking for, which I'm sure no one else is. These stay on really well and they don't dry out my lips! This is the least drying of any matte lip product I have tried thus far. I wish there was a wider color selection, but I love the ones I have and will probably get one or two more."

Standout is my favorite because it's a very vivid color with zero shine. Sultry is better for casual days and I don't wear unapologetic too often because it clashes with my skin tone making it look orange. Last a good amount of the day if you're eating and drinking regularly, I don't eat till I'm home so it last all day for me. Great buy!"

I got it in &quot;Standout&quot; and again my medium/dark skin, its a nice not too bright/not too dark shade of red. I did however figure out that if you want it &quot;kiss proof&quot; only apply a thin layer (outlining the lip and blotting the inside of lips). it never transferred to anything i was drinking out of and lasted though my dinner (i ate a sandwich).

Stunning is a good red-orangey color on me, and since it's matte, I can wear it with almost anything. Shameless is dark purple.

I do use a little vaseline or aquaphor under it just to make it last but to also smooth out teh color over my lips.  Without it the color is a little much and looks a tad cakey on lips.  That being said it's the perfect lip color when mixed with a little Vaseline."

I have &quot;Standout&quot; and &quot;Sultry&quot; and love them!<br /><br />Standout is such a deep, rich red! It goes on easily, lasts, and looks so elegant. &quot;Sultry&quot; is a great fall/winter pink and is such a rich, creamy color!<br /><br />I love these because they are creamy and rich and don't look dry when you apply like some matte lipsticks. This also has a minty tingle that feels great on my lips.<br /><br />I find that matte lipsticks in general can show imperfections in the lips. If you have dry lips take a wash cloth and some Vaseline. Rub a generous amount of Vaseline on your lips and use the cloth to rub the lips. Do this until your lips are silky smooth!"

It's a &quot;true&quot; red -- not brick, not orange, but a real red with blue undertones. You can wear it full-on for a dramatic look, or blot to more of a stain and pair with a lip balm. It's truly a fantastic color. Great for fall/winter. Happy to have it back in rotation. Application is not super easy -- you need a mirror and possibly a tissue at the ready -- but it's worth the bother and is budget friendly, too."

This balm is not sold as a stain, but it has such great pigmentation that it is long lasting and almost stains the lips.  I really like the deep color of sultry and think its a great night look color, when I wear it during the day, I blend it with honey in the Just Bitten line.  The matte effect of the balm does not dry out lips but stays even and does not have any shine, it is a true matte color.  I will definitely be trying more shades in this line."

Usually lipsticks do NOT last on me, and I have to keep reapplying, this one lasted all morning, and only came off when I was eating. It's a great color for my (brown) skin tone."

Love it!!! Great coverage and smooth texture without dying. lasts for hours without touch ups."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","c","San diego",1,"Although the product smelled amazing it looked horrible on my lips. Granted, my lips were a bit on the chapped side but this made my lips look and feel dryer. Not moisterizing in the slightest. The color was ok but not something I would recommend."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","DaisyBelle","OH",5,"&quot;Standout&quot; is my perfect color for classic red lips. I've tried a ton of red lipsticks and they're always too bright and neon, or too harsh for my pale skin, or they make my teeth look yellow. This color is perfect though. The formula is ok; they can be a little bit drying but they're still better than most other matte lip products I've tried, and I actually like the crayon format better than a regular lipstick."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Anne","Portland, OR",4,"So I bought Standout and Elusive. Both great, but Elusive was pretty patchy, which might just be the one I got because I'd read reviews saying that the only patchy one was Mischievous, but I didn't get that one so who knows. Anyway, Standout is the classic red, my go-to for everyday use, and Elusive is just a light, slightly mauve pink. Not sure how often I'll use that since it's so patchy.<br /><br />It's really drying if you use a lipliner under it, but if you only line your lips it's less drying. With reapplication it is hydrating again.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it gets used pretty quickly. You don't get a lot of product. When I bought it, I don't know why, but I assumed the whole tube had the balm in it, but it was only about an inch and a half's worth. I've only used it for two weeks and feel like a lot has been used, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, these are great, definitely would reccommend them, the cons aren't that big of a deal for me. Probably won't buy again, but it was worth my money."

I have a good collection of matte lipsticks and I couldnt resist buying one of these matte balms.  I love the texture- a great combination of moisture and mattifying that keeps in looking natural.

I love this product and every shade, but the application is uneven and the staying power is definitely not worth it. I also don't see the product being matte on my lips, maybe it will work for someone else!"

The only drawback I could find is that almost all the ones in the store have obviously been opened &amp; tried. Nothing that a dip in alcohol can't fix but super annoying."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Ray","Los Angeles, CA",4,"Love this product, the only issue I have with it is that it looks a little flaky on my lips but I do not know if it because I need to exfoliate my lips before use, I have not tried that yet.<br />I love that it is rich in color and looks natural. These were hidden by the register and this is the last of the nude color. The cashier told me that these are flying off the shelf because they are so popular."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Ellen","Vermont",5,"I love this matte lipstick!! It is so not drying like some high end brands! Lasts for a good amount of time but not after eating which is fine because that's not how it's marketed. Not a lot of the shades are that wearable for me because it's hard for me to pull off dramatic lips but if you're that type of girl you will go crazy!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","msmeow85","Portsmouth, NH",3,"I purchased this in the color &quot;complex&quot; (the nude brown color). It's an okay color, a bit too orangey brown on me, but I like that it isn't too dark or high maintenance like a red/dark lip can be. It smells good, feels good (minty) and I like the packaging. BUT it clings to all the dry patched on my lips. I exfoliate them often so I feel like it shouldn't be such a problem. I have only been able to use this product and make it look nice by combining it with another lipstick or a gloss. (Try NYX Butter Gloss in Creme Brulee--it tones down the orange and makes a near perfect nude). I may try the Kissable Balm Stain but I didn't care for how dry this made my lips. The Lipsurgence by Tarte are better!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Chloe","Chicago, IL",4,"Very nice looking and feeling on the lips. I like to use a lip pencil with it and treat it like any other matte lipstick. The difference is the minty smell/feel and moisture. I will buy again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Lilasiris","NYC",5,"The shade range is unique for high end and drugstore products. No one else has a purple or bright orange like Revlon. When these first came out I was already overwhelmed with balm sticks from various brands, but I did buy one because I could't resist. I really love how pigmented these are and the finish makes even the brightest shades chic. These manage to be a soft matte, but those who suffer from dry lips will want a balm under it. I find them longer lasting than most balms, so it's a great product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","S","Milwaukee, WI",4,"For the price of this product, it works so well.  Plus you barely need to put the lip color on; it's so pigmented, especially the reds. The only negative thing about it is it gets a little dry/flaky after a couple hours. I recommend using it with a lip liner or finishing it with chapstick."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Sam","Chicago, IL",4,"This product is amazing! It is very creamy and has great color payoff. The only reason I did not rate it as perfect is because if you have small lips like mine, it can be a little tricky to apply. So a word of advice-take your time! I bought this product because it is almost an exact dupe for Candy Yum Yum. Definitely worth the money."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Lulu","Maryland",2,"This product does not stay on very long and is far less effective and more costly than at least two other products in the lip balm category (not permitted to mention those products by name) which perform far better and whose application looks much nicer, too."

I have pretty pigmented lips, so I tend to go with something more around my lip color, like nudes or golden brown colors.<br /><br />I got Sultry and it is a perfect match for my lips. I do use a lip spackle to prime them and then a baby lips dr rescue balm before putting the color on.<br /><br />I do that because while they are creamy, the lip color can be drying. So moisturize your lips very well and use a lip primer before using this.<br /><br />I think this is perfect for anybody and the color is just perfect. I high suggest the color Sultry."

Except this doesn't feel like a lipstick at all. It feels thin, you forget you're even wearing it and it doesn't transfer as easily as a thick lipstick. I truly recommend if you're looking for a lipstick alternative that's easy to touch up and take with you. The drugstore price doesn't hurt either :)"

I love the subtle matte finish and that the color stays on my lips for quite a while. It is not sticky or tacky feeling, which is wonderful. I would highly recommend this lip color to anyone wanting a fun pop of color that doesn't feel sticky on your lips and that lasts for a few hours without having to re-apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","modernmartha","Denver, CO",4,"Unapologetic is a vibrant, saturated, coral pink that is verging on neon. It promises a matte finish, and I think it lives up to that claim, but it's not an intense matte. It has a creamy look and feel that makes it easy to apply and very wearable and comfortable on the lips. <br /><br />The triple butter complex of Shea Butter, Coconut Butter and Mango Butter give the balm a smooth, gliding application and a creamy feel on the lips. The creamy feel only lasts for a couple hours though, and it does become drier throughout the day.<br /><br />If you have excessively dry, dehydrated lips, I wouldn't recommend this product for you. The product clung to the dry cracks in my lips. I think the moisturizing formula helped my lips from becoming drier than they already were, but it wasn't hydrating enough that the dry patches went away.<br /><br />I got 6 solid hours of wear out of the balm before I wanted to reapply/remove. It faded a bit, but the color started so vibrant, you could hardly tell. The color wore off the most on the outer corners of my lips and on the inner rim of my lips. It become dry to the point that even though I could have gotten another hour or two of great color wear, I had to remove and rehydrate my lips."

They look better in the tube than on my face. It goes on so blotchy and I can't get that smooth color, with and without prior lip balm application.  The balm stains are nicer. When I wipe it off, I look at it and think &quot;oh that's such a pretty color&quot; but on my lips, it's not a smooth or consistent application. Thoroughly disappointed."

Elusive looks to a be lighter version of the same, but unfortunately it comes of as chalky looking instead of creamy looking.  <br /><br />Both have a nice minty smell.

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","trailnut","EL, MI",5,"I have these in three colors - Sultry, Striking and Standout - and came here today to buy Striking again. It's a holy grail lippie for me. I suppose it's a coral red color but it reads as light red on me because it doesn't pull pink or orange (though it is very warm toned.). I can wear it full strength for the most flattering red lip but mostly wear it with my favorite balm for a sheer lipstick look. It brightens my face and brings out my blue-green eyes without looking too harsh against my light, warm toned skin. I use it to color-adjust lots of other lippies, too. The formula really plays well with other products. When I want to highlight the natural color of my lips, I wear Sultry. It's such a good match (but a little more pigmented) that I sometimes use it as a lipliner.<br /><br />These are amazing, especially for a drugstore product. I regularly try drugstore lipsticks, balms, etc because the colors are so enticing but I find the colors almost never stay true on my lips -- they turn very pink or purple within minutes -- and most have a very uneven or patchy wear pattern or smear around or dry out my lips. Since there aren't a lot of colors that look good on me, I end up buying much pricier products to get what I need. And it's still not easy to find pricey products that don't do those things mentioned above, especially if you want to wear them less than full strength. These matte lip balms are a major exception. The texture is beautiful -- no dead or parched looking matte here -- and it goes on so easily. BTW, these have &quot;balm&quot; in their name but they're pretty intensely pigmented and are opaque... at least the colors I've tried.<br /><br />I prefer to wear sheer lipsticks during the day and with the formula of these there's no need to hunt for sheer versions of the gorgeous colors available here. A light dab of these will give a nice matte stain look (though they don't actually stain my lips that much). These also play very well with every type of balm and lip product I've used to get sheer dewy or shiny looks. And the colors stay true when thinned out. This is tough to find, especially with reds. Most have extremely strong pink undertones that leave no trace of red behind when thinned out.<br /><br />Almost forgot&hellip;I love the packaging. Not glamorous, I know, but very user friendly. The cap is secure and the color makes it easy to grab the right one out of my bag. The fat pencil that doesn't require sharpening makes application and maintenance effortless."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Blair Waldorf","St. Paul, MN",5,"This is the most amazing product I've get used. I wore it the first time to a party and two days later my lips were still red. It's nearly impossible for me to find a lip color product that actually stays on my lips because my lower lip is big and color just doesn't stay on easily without fading or collecting/chapping. This NEVER happens with Revlon's crayons. Even if that wasn't an issue for me, I would still love this. The color is so pigmented and it feels amazing on my lips. It smells minty and feels so soothing. Sometimes I put on extra just because it feels so good. I just can't recommend this enough."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Khetto","Wisconsin",4,"I put this on lightly, sometimes with a little bit of chapstick, and the color is quick to appear. If i layer it on heavier, it gets much darker, so depending on how you apply it, it looks great with whatever look you're trying to achieve. It's moisturizing and a very pretty color. It tends to fade from the inside of my lip to outside, so I have to check it every once in awhile to make sure my lips aren't weirdly discolored. Other than that, I love it!"

The buttery consistency is perfect for dry lips and everyday use, and the minty smell is so soothing. My go-to color is sultry, and I get so many compliments; I'm on my third tube! They are also perfect for &quot;rest&quot; days in-between other drying lipsticks. The best part is how matte and pigmented they are! Typically, I have found that tinted balms have messy, sheer, unappealing applications, but this product is as pigmented as any other matte lipstick. A+ rating from me, would recommend."

The plastic was difficult to take off to open this product and overall I would not recommend this to a friend. This product goes on similar to that of an old and dried out tube of lipstick. The color is nice, but I still put on some extra product to blend it in and make it not look cakey."

I was looking for a good quality lipstick and a friend recommended that I try this. And let me tell you, after my first two I wanted to order this product in every color!<br /><br />This balm looks like a giant retractable lip caryon, glides right on like a regular lipstick. Impressed with how long it lasts on your lips (well it is a stain) even if it rubs off there will still be color on your lips. You can wear these without lip balm underneath and it is moisturizing enough but with the lip balm it gives it a bit of a shine to it. After applying you do get a minty/fresh feeling. Colors I got are really pigmented; Elusive, which is kind of a pinkish mauve and Standout which is almost like a bright cherry red."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Sarah","North Whales PA",2,"doesn't last long at all. drys out my lips. however, the color is very pigmented really love the colors, they smell and taste like mint which i love. have to reapply many times during the day."

I find that some of the lipstains work better for me, but these colors are soooo pretty and pigmented. i have fair, neutral skin and so far have tried Elusive. It's like a lighter, rose pink version of my lips. I LOVE it. can't wait to try Unapologetic and Mischivious next."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Emily","NJ",5,"The product itself is excellent - buildable, shiny color that doesn't fade, feather or feel sticky.  The slightly minty flavor is nice but not overwhelming.  It is really everything I could ever want in a shiny lip balm.<br /><br />The only problem with this product is the seal.  It's very flimsy and can easily be opened and then resealed.  It is very important to double check the item to make sure it has not been used and then resealed and put back on the shelf."

This lip stick gives a beautiful color payoff, and doesn't budge until you eat something. But even then most of the color stays on, almost like it's a stain!

I finally found them and picked up 2 colors since most were already gone and I love them. They have the perfect matte texture and give a good color. It would be good to exfoliate you lips before applying this product though because it does kinda show all the little dry and chapped spots. Other than that I love this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","aj_2000","lawton oklahoma",5,"Revlon has been hitting them out of the park lately,and these new matte and shiny balms are no exception.  Very wearable matte, didn't excenuate my dry lips or stray without a liner."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","Sadie S.","Nashville, TN",5,"I purchased this in Striking and it is a lovely shade of red! It is so flattering and makes me feel more beautiful! This is the best lip color I've purchased EVER. Seriously, ever. It glides on beautifully and stays for so long! With regular lipstick I am always self-conscious of smearing, getting it on my face or teeth. This is not the case with this product.  I would love to see them add more colors to the collection, but I am so happy with what I have!<br /><br />To best use this product I would suggest exfoliating your lips and applying a lip balm 5 minutes before you apply this color."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","NicoleD","Kenosha,Wi",5,"I have purchased six of the matte shades. I have Elusive, which is a lighter pastel kind of pink, and the least favorite of the shades I bought. Audacious, which is a coraly orange and I will get use out of in the summer time. Unapologetic, which is a really bright and in my opinion wearable pink. Striking is a really flattering red which I think will suit a lot of people and it is the least opaque out of the ones I purchased. Standout is a really beautiful brick red color great for the fall/winter season. And lastly, shameless which is purple and I mean purple! If you pat it in instead of applying it straight to your lips it becomes a much more wearable color. The product applies completely opaque and it has a wonderfully soft texture the reflects in the balm name. The staying power is great. Revlon did an awesome job creating a product that is matte and doesn't catch on any dry patches on your lips."

My lips are naturally darker (mostly toward the outer corners)  but this lip balm makes my lips look one color and i absolutely love that. Also, the texture, although matte, it is very satisfying to the lips and quite comfortable, not drying, and it smells like mint, leaving your lips feeling fresh and cool"

So yes, the colors are great. Its very comfortable even though its matte and I swear theres some sort of tingly sensation (perhaps plumping?) when you apply it. Unfortunately theres nothing special to it....just a pigmented balm..I know drugstore prices these days are just rising but I'd only buy it on sale or with a coupon!"

The Sultry shade is a perfect pinkish brown color.  I've decided to pick up the Standout (red) shade as well.  If you are looking for a light, velvety finish, definitely try this."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","alyson","Escondido, CA",5,"Great color!  I love bold colors. I had only tried nudes in this product before and was hesitant to get the bolder colors as I am very picky about my reds and purples. But both were exactly what I was looking for.

"http://www.ulta.com/colorburst-matte-balm?productId=xlsImpprod6010256","KC","Phoenix, AZ",4,"I bought this in a bright red shade, and it is a solid product.  The color lasts for 4-5 hours without eating, and doesn't wear too much even with eating.  It's not moisturizing, but it's not drying either, and it has a nice subtle mint smell.  If you are looking for an affordable lip color that lasts, this is worth it."
