"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","HazelEyes","New Orleans, LA",4,"I have been sorta obsessed with experimenting with blushes lately. I tend to stick to a natural look and use bronzes daily but I chose to try this color and it is so beautiful and very pigmented. You only need a little to get a perfect color on your cheeks. Revlon blushes always tend to be so beautiful. Definitely obsessed!"

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Beauty","Orlando",3,"I wish Revlon would stop changing their blush and bronzing lines.  Each release seems lower quality than the last. And if you like a color you might be out of luck when and if you go to repurchase."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","none","lafayette, la",1,"It's too orange on my skin and the powder crumbles and gets all over my clothes. <br />I had to go buy another brand."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Abbey","Charleston, SC",5,"I am extremely pale and struggle with finding blushes that look natural with good color and pigmentation. I'm super impressed with this blush and bought it on a whim, not really paying attention. Boy am I glad that I grabbed this blush, because it is now my go to color for any event."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Queen B","Eugene, OR",2,"this product instantly started to deteriorate as soon as I began to use it. I will never get this again would suggest another bronzer."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","cupcake83115","Portland, ME",1,"This blush goes on really well and lasts all day, but it caused horrible  breakouts on both my cheeks! I bought this in &quot;Oh, baby! Pink&quot; and it was a beautiful color, just a shame it didn't work well for my skin."

I've searched and searched for a better blush at this price point and can't find one i like better! Even the more expensive blushes aren't as good for me!"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Gucc","Valencia, CA",5,"Lucky, bought it to replace a different brand/color, very happy with and will continue with."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","par","Houston, TX",1,"The blush is fine once you can get to it, but trying to open the container every day is a chore. I have to use a nail file or a tweezers or a scissor to get pry it open."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","jewels","South Carolina",5,"Loved the gentle peachy hue, it was just enough color for contrast while looking natural."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","ChihuahuaLover","Watertown, SD",5,"These are easy my favorite drugstore blushes. I used Racy Rose (which I'm guessing is discontinued now) every day back in high school and I recently bought Dare to Bare. I think these are great for beginners in makeup, but still great for advance makeup users as well."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Jul","Iowa",4,"Brush that came with is too small."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Makeup Mommy","Tampa, FL",2,"If you love blush like me, then Revlon isn't going to give you the POP of color you are looking for. <br />Its a very light powder and I was almost scrubbing my brush into it to see if any of it would stay on. <br />I ended up with Maybelline blush in a deep coral and that worked great for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Crisel","West Chicago",5,"I always use revlon for my blush on, very natural looking and lasts all day! Also, you don't need to put a lot, only a few dabs and you're good to go."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","camper","Washington",5,"This is a great blush for fair skin! It gives a great natural flush of color, if applied well. Since using it every day for the past few months, I have since gotten it for my sister because she loved it so much!"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Luna","California",3,"Bought this blush on a whim since it was on super sale. It doesn't work as a blush for my medium beige latina skin tone but it does work very nicely as a highlighter or when I just want a very natural hint of color. I have oily skin and it's quite long lasting (I use primer and setting powder). I also has a very pretty hint of shimmer."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Quin","Philadelphia PA",4,"I like this blush but i love the size of the pan"

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Natural and pretty style","Nashville",4,"This has nice, light coverage.  I do have to layer it a bit, but I guess I would rather do that than risk having a too heavy, clowning looking blush."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","jillijill","Salt lake City, UT",4,"I use this as a cover base then use a different blush on top/ blends in well with my skin tone"

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","VM","Dallas, TX",5,"Love how this blush has some gold glitter in it. I don't use highlights so this has some shimmer in it already which I like."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Ang","Decatur al",2,"Color is a lot different when applied."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","e","ny",4,"nice light color to highlight cheek bones for the summer!"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Satisfied ULTA customer","Fort Smith, AR",5,"I love the way Revlon Colorstay wears all day with no touch up, unless you're a perfectionist. I usually touch up slightly, because my phone headset rubs some off at the hairline. But probably not enough that a guy would notice."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","G-Maa","Sacramento",2,"The color was very nice, but the product has crumbled and cracked after only three days of use."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","S.","USA",5,"The color is very rich and  appears the same on the face as in the package. Feels silky and weightless and blends effortlessly."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","M","Austin",5,"I usually purchase Revlon blushes: the color is good, they last all day, and they don't make me breakout"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Dhipp","Dallas, Tx",5,"I love Revlon lip crayons so I decided to try their powder blush. So good! I got it in Haute Pink. It's nicely pigmented for a blush at this price point, but not so much to where it gives me unnatural coloring on my cheeks. As usual with drugstore blushes, I toss the given 'brush' and use my higher-end brushes to get a good application."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","HeidiSusie","Central PA",4,"I was looking for a pretty coral blush, but I didn't want it to be too orange or too pink. This was perfect and I looked EVERYWHERE! I love the color. The only negative is that it's a bit messy. When you brush over the blush a lot of extra powder comes up that ends up making a mess and being wasted. Other than that, it's great!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Erika23valentino","Fairfield, CA",5,"I use this product for my everyday natural work look. I definitly get compliments on my skin. My number one about this product is it goes on smooth."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","sami","AZ",4,"i recently got this in 'mauvelous'. it's not super pigmented, but the color is still nice and it's not really shimmery. i like it. just make sure you have your own brush, because the brush it comes with is not good at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Dianne","Manteca, CA",3,"Have used other Revlon blushes.  Trying new color."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","KaseyRenee","Chicago, IL",5,"In the package this color looks really bright, however, if blended lightly this blush looks beautiful on fair skin. Just right amount of shimmer. I have used name brand blushes before and this works just as well.  Save your money!"

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Jeepster","Lexington, KY",4,"I've used this blush for years.  Recently, Revlon changed the available colors, so I'm disappointed that I can't buy the one that I used for years."

"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Sherry","Sacramento ca",5,"I use the blush on my cheekbones and around my face which gives a brighter look to my face."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Halflotus","South Florida",1,"You can't tell that that you are wearing blush unless you put it on over and over.  Not worth the time and money."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Gem that Brooklyn girl","NYC",5,"It's great it's just my personal preference that the color isn't what I thought this seems really dark but it's a great product"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Bev.  the gardener","Downers Grove Illinois",4,"The cost of the product  is bearble, but wish it would go on sale<br /> more often<br /> Like the cssing it is in and size of container"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Stacey Fox","Gideon, MO",4,"This powder applies well. The color is fresh and it blends well with my foundation powder and my skin tone. It is one of my favorite blushes!"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","......","Ogden, UT",4,"This blush is very pigmented so a little goes a long ways. I think this blush will last me awhile, glad I tried it! Next time I think I'll try one of the lighter shades."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Emily","Chicago, IL",4,"I bought this to be an everyday running around blush and it works perfectly for that.  It is light and very natural looking.  I wouldn't use this for dramatic makeup or if I was going out, but everyday casual use it is great."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","CS","Kansas City",4,"Great color (fair skin), can use very little with getting a great effect - will last a long time ."
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Drea","Portsmouth, OH",4,"I like this blush. It has a very good color for darker tones and it's buildable. The price is great too"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Summergirl051","Laredo, TX",5,"I always used to buy the pink and mauve blushes, but they never complimented my skin, and overall look. I tried this orange blush, and it goes perfectly with my fair to medium skin. I have mild acne, and the redness of it sometimes pick through, so a pink blush never looked good on me. But this orange blush changed my views on applying blush. Love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/powder-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320736","Sadie S","Nashville, TN",5,"I never leave the house without blush on so I've tried a variety of different brands and types. This is highly pigmented and I love it! A little goes a long way! The little brush even does pretty decently if you're traveling and don't have room for all your brushes. I like the color a lot and I really want to try the other colors!"
