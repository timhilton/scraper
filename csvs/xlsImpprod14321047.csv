I kept using it for a few weeks thinking maybe I just needed to get the hang of it since it had a different applicator tip than the eyeliner I had been using previously, but no matter how you hold this pen, or which edge of the tip you use, it goes on like an absolute mess. Save your money and go with another brand. The only positive aspect of this product is that it is long-lasting and still looks good at the end of the day."
