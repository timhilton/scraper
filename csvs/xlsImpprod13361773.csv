"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Tcn011","Baltimore maryland",5,"I absolutely love this mascara, it comes off easily, no clumping it lasts all day to look nice."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Lalalinds","Evansville, IN",1,"This product is a sad excuse for a lengthening mascara. It flaked all day and had no volume. My lashes &quot;fell&quot; as the day progressed, resulting in shorter clumpy lashes. I will be returning this product. Hoping to stick with Revlon mascara, but very sad my favorite Fabulash line has been discontinued. Fingers crossed I find a suitable substitute."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Amanda","Texas",1,"Unfortunately they changed the formula and I don't like it at all. I will not continue to use. Back to a competitor sad to say I really liked it before."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Kathryn","New York, NY",1,"I don't understand why Revlon can't just copy mascara from other companies, as I have never once bought a Revlon mascara that works well.  Unlike other lengthening mascaras  - for example, Mayelline's Stlletto - this so called lengthening mascara  doesn't lengthen!  Not only that, but by the end of the day, you can hardly tell you're wearing anything!  AND, it does rub off under your eyes.  What a disappointing product.  DO NOT BUY."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Lily Bell","Florence SC",5,"Easy to apply due to a easy handle brush"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","GB","Orange County, CA",5,"I have naturally thick eyelashes, so all I want in a mascara is length. This product delivers what I am looking for. I put it on, and it gives a ton of length. My eyelashes get so long that they almost touch my eyebrows. It stays on all day and is not clumpy on me. This is one of my favorite mascaras. I am sad that it doesn't have good reviews since I love it."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Roc","Sparks Nv",1,"It does not last long half way through my shift it was flaking off I work an 8 hour work day .... would not buy again."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Noah Bowser","Ogden, UT",5,"I use it for everyday. I don't really have elongated eyelashes but this one makes them look fuller."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","DEE DEE","NEW LENOX ILLINOIS",1,"I DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL, DOES NOT ADD VOLUME LIKE IT SAYS, YOU CAN BARELY TELL ITS EVEN ON YOUR EYE LASHES."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Mary","Tennessee",1,"This is a very poor formula with a cheap brush. The brush is literally shedding and at this point there's no telling if it's going to last longer than the mascara or not. Plus the formula is extremely flaky and doesn't last for More than 3-4hours. This is a waste of money."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","RedFoxHeidi","Las Vegas, NV",1,"I found that it did an adequate, but not mind-blowing job of lengthening my lashes. I wish the tube would have made it more clear that it contained fibers, something I normally steer clear of but I stuck it out anyway. Like other reviewers I also found the brush to be pretty large, but workable. My problem was when the formula started to kind of clump together in the tube and on the wand. No problem, I'd just wipe the wand. But after only 10 weeks, the mascara became gluey and gummy- this morning I pulled the wand out of the tube to find a string of what I'd compare to black chewed gum being pulled out of the tube. Tossed it immediately. I contacted Revlon Customer Service who is having me send the tube back for study. I'd avoid this at all cost until it's reformulated."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Ashlyn","Pittsburgh, PA",2,"I wore this on a daily basis until i realized that halfway through the day I looked like a raccoon! It smudges horrible especially if you are putting it on your lower lashes! It's not worth the purchase."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Cal","Midvale Utah",1,"Once you put it one don't even think about touching your lashes or it will flake off. Not thrilled"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Tiff","Chicago, il",1,"The brush seemed to big."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","KLH","WA",1,"I've never had mascara that is literally gone when I get home from work. I don't mess with my eyes during the day, and it's not even on days I go to the gym. It's as if I never put any on. I bought the red one - the everything formula- and I was too dumb to use the brush. If I had either receipts I would take them both back. But now I have them both and hate them both!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Raven","Jacksonville, Florida",3,"I didn't notice my lashes looking any longer. But they were very dark and defined so not a waste."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Shammu","Houston, TX",1,"This mascara did nothing to make my short lashes look even a little bit longer.  I kept going over and over my lashes, but the product never really coated them.  What's the point?  I returned it, without any hassles.  Thank you, Ulta!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Sherry","Chicago IL",2,"It goes on nicely with the huge wand<br /><br />Doesn't stay<br />Drys and flakes off"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Bev","Dorton Kentucky",3,"The brush is to fat but for the price it will be ok to use."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","RtiQlitQT","Midwest USA",1,"The first use was okay.  The second use on the next day was a flakey mess with little bits of the mascara falling out.  When I pulled the spoolie wand out on the third day, I noticed pieces of the bristles in the mascara.  Immediately drove back to return it!  Very scary!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Shan","Texas",2,"I don't like that the fibers flake and irritate your eyes"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Beka","El Paso,Tx",5,"GREAT Mascara from Revlon!!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Lls","Syracuse NY",1,"Didn't add length. Waste of money"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","tc117","West Virginia",3,"I just bought this and tried it out for the first time. It isn't bad. The brush is definitely bigger than I expected but it's not a problem. The brush actually reminds me of Benefit's bad gal lash mascara. The formula is ok, kind of in between a wet and dry formula. It lengthens and separates pretty well. I haven't  noticed any flaking like other reviewers mentioned but I haven't worn it long. Also, for the ones saying that their lashes fell out on the brush or that the brush was losing bristles, those are the fibers that are there to adhere to your lashes to make them appear longer! It says right in the description that there are fibers in the mascara. All in all, it's not a miracle worker but, it's a 6-8 bucks drugstore mascara, and for the price it's not bad at all."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Alisa","Mesa",1,"I've never had a brush that flakes so badly! The mascara itself is just okay, but my eyes have gotten so irritated that I gave up after only 2 weeks. What an awful investment!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Jaclyn","Princeton, KY",5,"I really enjoyed this mascara! I have super short and stubby eyelashes, and this helped with making them longer!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Kelly H.","Laurel, MD",1,"Brush was good, but formula flaked almost instantly. Not volumizing (not marketed as such, so that's okay). Lengthened adequately. More importantly, flakes fell into my eyeball and the tube for some reason attracted and trapped some weird debris into it. I've never experienced that before and haven't experienced it since."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Meg","New York",1,"Bring back lash potion! I switched to this mascara because Revlon discontinued lash potion, which I've been using for the past four years. This product made my lashes fall out, I can visibly see them on the brush. Time to search for a new brand of mascara."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Helen","North Carolina",5,"This mascara did not clump for me at all, despite all of the bad reviews. The mascara lengthens very well and makes your eyelashes look like falsies! Easy to put on, but dries pretty quickly. I usually do two coats, making sure to separate with the brush."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Beauty blender","Ohio",5,"Like it for the price"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Kerber","Omaha, NE",1,"This is the chunkiest mascara ever!  I've used so many different kinds, but thought I would give this one a try. It flakes 30 seconds into my day.  I constantly had to wipe the flakes from under my eyes."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","geebee","Ormond Beach, FL",1,"Although it is promoted as lash-separating, it clumps.  The applicator is very large and clumsy to use.  Would not recommend at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Rachel","MD",1,"Do not like it."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Disappointed","Philadelphia",3,"I was really disappointed with this mascara. It's very thin so it's necessary to apply numerous coats and then by the end of my work day it had completely flakes off every single time."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Terry","Lafayette, LA",5,"I'm 58 yrs old and have used a gazillion different mascaras.  Maybe it's a senior citizen thang, but nowadays, most mascaras make my eyes burn, turn red and flat out miserable.  I barely had eyelashes when I was younger, but less now since I'm well...getting old.  I need mascara no matter what and yes, I've used Revlon products before (duh!) but I grabbed this particular one because it said &quot;lengthening&quot;.  It lengthens my lashes a little, but the best part (for me) is that it doesn't burn my peepers AND it makes my lashes look natural (i.e., not spider-like, spikey, unnaturally thick, globbed, etc. -- you know....Fake!)  I feel that I need to stock up on it incase they discontinue it.  LOL  Good stuff!"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Minnieb","New Jersey",4,"I would definitely buy again. I also layer it with voluminous from loreal and it makes it look you are wearing false etelashes"

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Chris","Carol Stream, Il",4,"I only put on one coat.  If you try to put on multiple coats, it flakes.  One coat is enough.  It does seem to dry out after about 6 weeks.  I do not mind replacing it every 6 weeks because it is affordable."

The product barely gets on my eyelashes. I think the brush is too big and the formula is too sticky."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Sherri","Las Vegas",1,"I hate this mascara - the problem with Revlon is that they are not what they say unless you have false lashes.  I would suggest Rimmel mascara - way better"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13361773","Darla","Charlotte, NC",2,"Bought for teenage daughters. Product description sounded great and past experience with Revlon has been good, but this formula is WAY too thin to add any volume or length, and lashes don't hold shape.
