I'm usually not a fan of large mascara brushes, but this one applies cleanly, and I don't accidentally stab myself in the eye when I use it. However, I have yet to find an eye makeup remover that will take this stuff off. I haven't been wearing it very often because I don't want to go through the battle of trying to remove my eye makeup with fourteen different products at the end of the day."
