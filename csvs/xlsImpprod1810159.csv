I've tried other combination/oily foundations and I think this is one of the better ones. It's really nice if you don't want to put on a full face of makeup and just want to even things out. My only complaint would be that it is really runny and a little hard to apply."

I have no idea how it is supposed to be for dry skin, because it is the most drying foundation I have ever used. After about 30 minutes of wear, it made my skin feel stiff and like it was going to crack! By the end of the day, my face looked horribly patchy and flaky. Wouldn't recommend! :("

This was the bargain buy, so I thought I would try it first. This has amazing coverage, and blends beautifully.  I wore it all day for my bachelorette party and got a million compliments. When it goes on it looks thick, but once you get it smoothed out and it sets, it looks perfect."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","nakedskin","milwaukee, wi",1,"I bought this foundation because my skin has been incredibly dry as of late, and because it says &quot;normal to dry skin&quot; I did not think this would cake on me, but it clung to every dry patch I had AND THEN SOME. It looked like my skin had every bit of moisture stripped from it and then this was applied. It really was horrible looking. I checked the bottle three times because I thought I had accidentally bought the oily skin one. It even felt drying on my skin. Did not like this product at all."

After years of trying to find the perfect foundation (because I am as pale as Snow White) that doesn't make me look orange, I finally found one!

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","RevlonLover","Nashville, TN",3,"I love Revlon!! Before discovering what my skin type was, I regularly used Revlon 370 Toast/Hale-Combination/Oily Skin, which stays matte. My skin is dry and unfortunately the make up would cake sometimes. Revlon's 370 Toast/Hale - Normal/Dry Skin is not the same shade as the the Combination/Oily Skin and while I liked the sheer look it gave my skin, the colour was way off. In noting that I have to rectify this, I may have to buy a few shades lighter in the Normal/Dry Skin line."

This foundation is perfect! It provides amazing coverage and lasts FOREVER. It's also waterproof, which was a nice surprise. I went swimming and rub water off my eyes quite often, and when I got home I noticed my makeup didn't even budge! <br /><br />I apply a very small amount (about nickel-sized) to the back of my hand after shaking it well. You can apply it with your favorite foundation brush, just make sure you blend it right away - don't put dabs all over your face and then slowly blend all of them. If you don't blend it right away, it doesn't blend very easily and you'll end up streaky. The only bad thing about this product is that, since it stays on your face so well and so long, it also stays on your brush very well. It's not a big deal, I've just noticed it builds up on my brush much quicker than other foundations have, so you just might have to wash your brushes more frequently. <br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific foundation. It covers blemishes very well and gives you a natural look that really does last all day. I HIGHLY recommend you buy this!"

I have always searched for a foundation that lives to it's name and is ACTUALLY long lasting, and after doing some research, I came across this foundation. Let me tell you, it is true to what it claims. I always hated how other foundations I used rubbed off constantly, but this foundation stays put and is very long lasting. It also never makes my skin feel oily, or heavy, like some other liquid foundations and also has great coverage. I may never go back to any other foundation."

This foundation lasts all day and i love that it is super buildable. The only problem was figuring out how to use it because I am not used to liquid foundations and it is a pretty thin liquid, but I ended up just pouring a bit on a makeup sponge and applying it with that. Overall great foundation for a heavier coverage!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","TacoLady","Phoenix,Arizona",1,"I very much dislike this foundation. It is absolutely AWFUL for dry skin like mine. I've tried this product many times over the course of a year. I thought trying it with different products each time would work but, nope, didn't work. Tried it with a beauty blender, a stippling brush, a normal foundation brush. Tried using less, using more, mixing it with moisturizer; nothing worked.It is cakey, super cakey; it looks like I'm legit wearing flour on my face when I apply it. It NEVER dries and it's sheer. It doesn't cover ANY of my acne scars or redness whatsoever! I've tried using it in a thick amount to get more coverage but, it was STILL sheer, no matter what method of putting it on my face I used. I thought that this was just a bad batch. So, I went back and bought two more; they were all the same. It also caused me to break out not even 4 hours later. My face was taken over by pimples and it was awful. I really, really dislike this product and I'm very unhappy with it. I don't understand why it gets so much hype but, in my opinion I don't think it deserves it. I really wished it worked for me, though."

A little goes a long way. I do like the color match for me and I like that it lasts all day long. It easily goes from day to night! The cons: difficult to remove. I have to use Ponds cold cream, then my regular cleanser."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Meygan","Salem, OR",5,"Absolutely LOVE this product! Best foundation I've used so far! Not only was I able to find my exact skin tone (which is sometimes difficult, especially with drugstore foundations), but the application and finish are just incredible. It is very long lasting, but I do find that it tends to wear down a little at my nose halfway through the day, but that's a quick enough fix and not too big a deal at all! <br /><br />Definitely good for dry/normal skin tones."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","robyn","Bowling Green, KY",4,"I've found that this foundation tends to cling to dry patches and really makes the dry skin on my nose look more noticeable. I've tried applying with a buffing brush and a damp beauty blender sponge, also with and without primer. The finish is very matte, which is not what I was expecting since this is supposed to be a foundation for people with dry skin. The coverage is really great and I find that it lasts throughout a normal day pretty well. Overall, I think it's a very good foundation but it doesn't work on my moderately dry/combo skin at all. <br /><br />However, I also tried the Revlon Nearly Naked foundation and it is amazing! Slightly less coverage than the Colorstay, but much smoother application and more natural finish."

I stopped using it and recently went back but it's not the same great product I loved. It smells great but the coverage is really lacking and within a few hours my nose is shiny. I'm glad for the SPF but wish the old formula would come back. I have sensitive, dry skin, and am looking for something with more coverage as this is very light."

This is good if you want more coverage, may feel a little heavy at first, the heaviness disappears after a while.  Not oily like the Age Defying DNA Makeup.  A little product goes a long way.  Only thing I don't like, it doesn't come in a pump.  So I just pour some on my hand first."

I have tried all the other drug store brands, plus 2 of the more expensive brands. I just wasn't finding something that met all my needs. I feel like I really have with this one! I am 26..with dry to normal skin..but I do tend to break out on my chin area. These are all the pro's I found with this foundation. 1-It blends well, I don't find that it dries to fast (before I can blend it) and can be &quot;built up&quot; to a full coverage on problem areas. 2- Matches my skin pretty much perfectly. Gives me a &quot;flawless&quot; look, with out looking caked on or &quot;made up&quot; up close. 3- It does Not sink into my fine smile lines to bad (any foundation will at some point in the day..some more then others). 4- It does last a very long time. Does it look perfect after 8 plus hours, No. Does my face still look fresh and nice, Yes! 5- It does NOT contain talc or fragrance (someone commented on the smell..Umm..there is no smell?) 6- Not drying or caused any breakouts. 7- Affordable! CONS- Only One: They need a better color selection. Some that contain pink undertones and some with yellow. Might be hard for some people to find there perfect match. Sooo happy I tried this foundation!!!! I really love it!"

Even though the lightest shade matches my skin perfectly (which is rare considering I have very very pale skin) I am very disappointed with this product. It's supposed to be for dry skin...however, after moisturizing underneath, applying hydrating primer, and this foundation on top, it still made my skin peel. No other foundation for dry skin that I've tried has done this. Also it visibly clogged my pores. However, the only pro I can mention is that it stayed on all day, which is pretty amazing considering my hands are always on my face lol. But other than that, I would not reccomend this foundation if you have dry skin like I do."

Well, it's definitely light weight.  Too light for me.  I found it sat on top of my skin, and never settled in the right way.  It felt soupy and too watery, causing more of a buildup than blend in.

It does stay on well and the coverage is ok plus there are a lot of colors to chose from. However I was not wowed by this as I thought I would be. I thought the coverage was just ok and I didn't really feel it made my complexion look amazing as I thought it would after reading some other reviews. I think the whipped foundation has a better result than this. It is worth a try but if you really want amazing coverage that, in the end, makes you appear flawless this type may not be the one."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","thehoney","TN",4,"I've had oily skin all my life and have been buying makeup for my greasy skin for 20 years. But now that I'm in my 40's, I realized my foundation was sliding off worse than ever. Turns out my aging skin had gone from oily to dry, and this dry skin version really truly stays longer because my skin isn't getting parched. The finish isn't as nice as my Too Faced Born This Way, but it stays on a full work day. The biggest problem is the color range in the dry skin version. There's very few choices, and none are a great match. I have yellow/olive medium skin tone, and these all pull too peach for me. I ended up going a shade too light and adding a little more bronzer to make it match. Would love to see more tone choices."

It actually looks very natural (I use warm golden for dry/normal skin).  It doesn't dry my skin at all and is longer lasting than other brands I've used.

It feels velvety smooth, lightweight, and never cakey, plus it literally lasts all day and still looks fresh at bedtime. The only downside is that I feel like it dries my skin out, which I compensate for by using loads of moisturizer. This might be my new favorite foundation, even with several high end brands in my collection. Good job, Revlon!"

It's buildable and matte but doesn't bring out dry skin flakes like I've had happen before. It will not move from your face! It's great for longer wear (like my best friend's wedding). It is kind of a pain to get off at the end of the day because of it's staying power. I was able to find the perfect shade for me when I had more color this summer but this winter I was not able to find the correct color for my warm skin tone.

I initially used it when I had dry skin in the winter, and it was a little too dark so I moved on from it. Now my skin is super oily and I ran out of my typical foundation so I started to use it again. I was a little skeptical about it at first because the foundation is for dry skin and I had oily skin and I was afraid it would leave me really greasy. But to my surprise it didn't! It gives really good coverage--it completely hid my hyper-pigmentation. It went on so smooth and my skin looks absolutely flawless. This foundation is great if you have dry skin but also want a matte finish, which is hard to find in most foundations for dry skin. The only problem I have with this foundation is that it's really really red. It might just be because I'm in the darkest shade. Overall, I love the foundation; just wish it suited my skin tone more."

It covers well, except where skin isn't a uniform texture - so not great over breakouts or sebaceous filaments. Doesn't cover pores very well.

I read a bunch of really positive reviews on this and was so excited to try it. <br /><br />First, I'd like to say I have pretty sensitive skin and I've been using this for about 2 weeks and haven't broken out. I have pretty nice skin. I don't usually get acne, but sometimes I have a few zits here and there. My cheeks are a bit red.<br /><br />I apply this with a damp sponge, and it covers flawlessly. It does dry very fast, but its okay. And it doesn't look cakey or fake. It looks like skin, which is the best part. It leaves a beautiful matte finish, and looks very natural, while still managing to have full coverage. <br /><br />I got it in the shade ivory, and I have very pale skin. I think the ivory shade might be a bit too light for my skin, so I just mix in half a pump of a darker shade foundation. A lot of people complain of a smell, but it doesn't bother me. When I first put it on, I can tell I'm wearing foundation, but after about 10 minutes it feels like I'm not wearing anything. <br /><br />It stays on all day, and still looks great when I get home. On the down side, its very hard to get off. I have to wash my face two times, and exfoliate to get it off. It also doesn't come with a pump, so its quite messy. But it's probably the best drugstore foundation I've used, and looks so good, its worth it. My friends have told me that my skin looks great! Definitely going to buy again."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","koolklawz","Chicago, IL",4,"I'm new to wearing makeup, but have heard good things about this foundation. It really is that good. This is a full coverage foundation, and I don't need much. It blends easily, and also plays well with other makeup types and formulas. I generally prefer medium coverage, so I find it a bit heavy, and it's not one I'd wear every day. It provides an excellent finish to my dry areas, keeping them matte without caking in any problem areas. It doesn't do the best job of controlling oil in my T-zone, though, and I keep the blotting papers on hand. I am considering trying the oily skin formula in those areas. Besides that, if you like full coverage, look no further."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Koolklawz","Chicago, IL",3,"I so wanted to love this foundation. I really tried. I tried with three different brushes, at least three primers, and beauty blenders. I achieved the best result with the beauty blender. It's lightweight and feels like next to nothing on my skin. Three drops are recommended, but for medium coverage, I used 4-6 drops. It spreads nicely, and the color range is excellent. I had a couple problems, though. First, while I prefer a matte finish, I don't mind a more dewy look. Every time I've worn this foundation, though, my face is an oil slick within 2 hours. I don't even have oily skin, except for the T-zone. Secondly, this foundation clings to any dry patches, even those I can't see or feel before application. Third, if you have any blemishes or skin imperfections whatsoever, this foundation only highlights them. So, it just doesn't work for me, either on oily or dry areas, and I only see it working for those with normal skin, no acne, and no scarring."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Adriana","San Diego, CA",5,"My makeup drawer is full of budget and high end foundations, this one is the one I use the most. I have normal to dry skin. I moisturize my face first and allow the moisturizer to full absorb. I use about one pump and a tiny bit more if I need more coverage, dispensed onto the back of my hand. I lightly dip my It Cosmetics # 101 brush (airbrush blurring foundation brush) into this foundation and then tap tap tap onto half of my face working from the outer perimeter of the face and work inward to avoid over applying. If you over apply it will appear 'cakey' later in the day, so less is more. Also make sure if you have flaky dry patches on your skin to exfoliate throughly BEFORE you moisturize and apply this foundation, or this will settle onto those areas and look awful. If you want light coverage apply using a damp beauty blender. I need medium to full coverage so I use the foundation brush.<br /><br />It really does last! I typically wear foundation 8-12 hrs and when I look in the mirror at the end of the day I'm pleased to see it has only faded a little bit but my skin still looks great. I've also tried the 'whipped' foundation version of this and that one leaves my face very matte, better for use in summer. This foundation leaves my face looking normal, like real skin, not matte or shiny. I buy 2 different colors of this foundation so I can mix them especially during the summertime when my skin is darker."

Gives full coverage with a foundation brush and a light-medium coverage with a sponge.  Liquid glides on smooth and is easy to blend with the initial application.  Finish is dewy without being shiny.  All-day wear that hydrates super-parched skin without caking or flaking.<br /><br />Cons:  Really only two and they're not big ones.  First, the formula sets really quickly, within a minute.  Once that happens the foundation is more difficult to blend.  I suggest applying in small sections.  The second, and this might only be me, but getting it anywhere near my eyes tends to make them water like crazy.

Recently when I emptied a bottle I decided to try something new instead in case I was missing out on something even better.<br />My skin reacted terribly to the different foundation. I never realized how much Colorstay for Dry Skin actually helped my skin as I wore it.<br />I've yet to find a foundation in Revlon's price range than can hold a candle to it.<br />Perfect coverage, lasts through nearly everything, has shade variety and caters to your skin type.<br />Couldn't ask for more :)"

Very few brands have a color that really matches my fair skin and undertones, but the Ivory shade matches my skin exactly.  My sister couldn't tell on first glance that I was wearing foundation!  <br /><br />This foundation provides good medium coverage, and it blends really well.<br /><br />The only downside is that it may irritate very sensitive skin.  I have sensitive skin, and after a couple hours I felt a little tingling in my cheeks.  The next day though I used a primer underneath, and the problem was gone.  I'm guessing it's the SPF because this product does feel really smooth and natural on my skin.<br /><br />Oh, and last thing!  For me, this foundation left a slightly dewy look.  I usually use Maybelline Translucent Finishing Mineral Powder on top of my foundation, so that my face looks perfectly natural (and extra soft)."

It isn't very runny and has much better coverage, that being said it dries FAST. So your fingers better work quick. Even in the dry skin formula I still don't like this for my dry skin.

I have used foundation before that smells horrible or is overpowering with smell, but this is neither of those things. My only suggestion is to only apply this product after you have fully exfoliated and moisturized your face if you have normal-dry skin. I cannot stress this enough! It really looks horrible if you don't. It looks crusty and doesn't apply well."

Although this is for normal/dry skin it is a matte finish... I haven't needed to buy a new one yet so I don't know if they've reformulated it or just added a pump to the foundation, but the original without the pump does have a matte finish.<br /><br />I have very very dry skin and prefer a satin/dewy foundation, but because the coverage, and longevity of this foundation is so good I don't mind that it is matte!  I just to hydrate my skin before and afterwards and use as little powder as possible. Nothing at the drugstore compares to Colorstay."

I would compare this to maybeline's matte and pore less in the shade 112 but maybelines have a pink undertone where as Revlon is yellow which I am so happy about! I bought 3 different shades of the maybeline hoping for more yellow but they were all pinkish ...at least to me anyways. I would definitely recommend this foundation."

It blends very well, looks natural, gives a dewy look and lasts all day. the only con, which i wouldn't consider it a bad con is that it is a light to medium coverage. You could probably build up the coverage with a beauty blender, but I only use a foundation brush. Another thing to know about this make-up brand's colors/shades is that the lightest shade is called ivory and is a true ivory color, but then the second and third shades are actually a medium color with orange/yellow tints and are called sand and buff and the next shade is called a nude but would be a classic ivory based on all other brand names for this shade. I mix one pump of ivory and one pump of nude to get my shade. Also, they have pumps on them!"

Eventually I decided to try out more cost-friendly products, since I was throwing away money buying the top brands only to have poor results.<br /><br />This product works very well, especially for the price. It is definitely full-coverage, so on days I want less coverage, I mix it with some primer and moisturizer on the back of my hand before applying. I did try the Revlon BB cream, with not so good results. Mixing my own works just fine!<br /><br />I can go from full-coverage without mixing to a nice sheer coverage easily. The product does not break me out but I do get a bit dry in my problem areas, although this is a small price to pay considering the value of this product."

You have to make sure that when you blend it, that you blend it quickly because it will adhere to your face and not want to budge. What I really love about this foundation, is that is gives awesome coverage, but isn't thick or super heavy. You know you are wearing a foundation, yet it doesn't feel like you are going to smear it over everything. It lasts a long time, but I do find that it can begin to dry out during the course of the day and start to look cakey. It's hard to imagine that it dries out when this formula is made for normal to dry skin. What I recommend doing for those who have dryer skin such as myself, is putting on a really good moisturizer or moisturizing primer immediately before putting on the foundation and setting the foundation with a setting spray like the urban decay all nighter, or chill setting spray. I hope this helped!"

It's so frustrating, and it is so difficult to find a good foundation that will hold up in warm humid weather. This is hands down the best I've found. It's not perfect, nothing stays on perfectly through sweating and blotting, but this is so much better than anything else.

I bought both versions of this product just to see how they would work and I really liked the oily one but it made my skin a bit dry and uncomfortable, but I didn't use any primer maybe it would have helped.<br />But the normal/dry was just great. I put it on without moisturizer just to test it and my skin felt comfy and had a nice glow.<br />One more thing. The normal/dry formula appears a bit darker than the oily one, but it does match perfectly when on skin.<br />I use 240 medium beige in both formulas.<br />The only tiny downside is that it is made with parabens.

I used to have extremely oily skin and this was the only foundation that wouldn't slide up! Their shade range is really nice for fair skin tones too! I am extremely light I use ivory 110 in the winter and porcelain 130 in the summer! I since have been on accutane and have incredibly dry skin now so I switched to the dry/normal one and it's still my favorite! Doesn't make my skin feel dry at all and it covers up any of my scars."

When people say it turns orange and oxidizes..they arent kidding. I went from pale to pumpkin within two hours. Also, if you have dry skin, don't use this. This goes out to people who have acne like me, it will show every bit of dryness you have. Covering a pimple is impossible."

But this is one I always come back to. <br />It lasts all day and it has good coverage. <br />The only downside is, if you have REALLY dry skin (like me), you will need to use hydrating primer underneath it. Or it will faintly cling to dry patches. I have yet to find a foundation that doesn't do that, since my skin is so dry."

I still do like it but after I tried the Tarte clay foundation, the Revlon colorstay have gone down on my list. It's because of the very bad creasing it does into fine lines and wrinkles and it transfers bad with or without powder or spray. Tarte foundation has a matte finish so it doesn't transfer and yes does creases but as long as I put a good primer under it it won't crease as much where Revlon does no matter what primer I use is creases like crazy. Tarte foundation is more money compared to Revlon but I would rather spend more money towards Tarte to get more positive out of it but the Revlon is still good just not as good though. It's still a lot better than Covergirl Trublend though. If your stuck between this Revlon colorstay vs Covergirl Trublend pick Revlon trust me."

Somehow, this is one of them. I have tried SO many foundations over the years, including pretty much every popular foundation on Youtube, and I always come back to Revlon. I would say that my skin is more &quot;combo&quot; than &quot;dry,&quot; but the combo/oily version just looks a tiny bit too cakey for my dry patches. Despite my skin not necessarily being &quot;normal/dry,&quot; this still wore beautifully. At the end of the day, I didn't want to take my makeup off because it still looked gorgeous. It didn't accentuate anything I wouldn't want it to, it didn't cake up, and it was just the perfect amount of glow without looking oily."

I bought this foundation (even though it isn't cruelty free) and I LOVE IT! The best thing I've tried EVER! It has amazing coverage and would probably last through the apocalypse. Blends well, stays matte, and even has SPF! The color (I'm &quot;Buff&quot; for once in my life) is a great match for me, too. A great yellow-toned pale shade.

The combination/oily version actually makes me more oily by the end of the day. I have the original version of the normal/dry in the glass bottle and I'm not sure if it contains sunscreen or not, but it doesn't make me greasy at all. I'm thinking it doesn't and that's probably why.  2. I have both normal/dry and combination/oily in the same shade, #180 and somehow  they are completely different colors. The normal/dry has a orange pink undertone which I hate and the combination/oily has more yellow brown undertone which I like. I need the normal / dry since it's less greasy but its a huge pain having to keep going back and forth exchanging trying to find the right color and type.

I have semi-oily, acne-scarred skin that struggles to look good under heavy makeup. I wanted something pigmented enough to cover my scarring, but light enough that it wouldn't sit heavily on my skin. I'm SO thankful that I got a recommendation for this product!<br /><br />I use Revlon Colorstay Foundation every morning. I find it easiest to apply lightly with my fingers, blending it well for a natural finish. It covers the worst of my scars and doesn't look cakey under powder. It lasts all day, even through 2 classes and 2 jobs, and I rarely need to powder my T-zone at all.<br /><br />Although I have semi-oily skin, I use the normal/dry formulation for Revlon Colorstay Foundation. I find that it blends in much more easily and it leaves a natural finish on the skin, as opposed to the matte finish left by the oily/combination skin formula. Someone with very oily skin, however, might find the oily/combo a better fit. I also appreciate the color range. I'm extremely fair, and most foundations and powders sit too dark and orangey on my face. The ivory 110 fits me perfectly, and I don't feel like I have to blend it down onto my neck for a natural look.<br /><br />I wish that Revlon would change the packaging of this product. I do not like the bottle; it always seems that I get too much or too little of the foundation, and it tends to get all over the neck and cap as well. If this had a pump, it would be absolute perfection!"

I have tried many high end foundations (NARS, Makeup Forever, Laura Mercier) so I was a bit skeptical in purchasing this, however I am SO happy that I did. After hearing the rave reviews about this foundation on YouTube I knew I wanted to try this one first. I have pretty normal skin that has some redness and a bit of acne scaring and this covers EVERYTHING! Beautifully as well. I've heard that this can get cakey on some people, but with a good mositurizer i've never had any problems whatsoever. This is my new drugstore HG foundation which I am totally excited to say! The coverage is great, it wears beautifully, and Sand Biege is a perfect match for my NC25 skin! I recommend this to anyone looking for a new foundation!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","catsmeow","Alabama",2,"I wanted to leave this review to help anyone who suffers from acne in deciding to use this foundation or not. My skin type is combination but tends to be more dry when I use foundation even though I moisturize so my skin tends toward the dry side. I had also tried the combination version of this makeup but found it to be drying. I tend to get acne on my chin area as well as forehead but this foundation made my acne worse and my skin developed clogged pores all over.<br /><br />This foundation was amazing for the first month or so I used it and it did not make my skin oily but it also did not dry out my skin. If you are not acne prone and are looking for a good foundation for dry skin I do recommend this but would also say to moisturize and use a primer beforehand. It does stay on extremely well and blends well. I also found the color to be perfect. It feels good as far as moisture is concerned. <br /><br />Although it does give good coverage and looks good after awhile it made my skin break out terribly and develop cystic acne on my chin. I know it was this product because I did not change anything else and also once I stopped using it it did get somewhat better. <br />If you have dry skin but are acne prone I would not recommend this because it will cause pores to clog and acne to form. I think it partially is because of its long lasting power but overall I do not recommend this for anyone slightly prone to acne."

It lasts me 8-10 hours without getting cakey. It is medium coverage- my redness sometimes shows through and I have to cover it with concealer. It blends pretty smoothly over the skin. My only problem with this  product is a flaw in the packaging that has caused my last two bottles to go off more quickly. The plastic lid covering the pump would get stuck to it, so the only way I could get to the foundation was to take the lid off, which is unsanitary. This caused the foundation to separate within only a couple of months- so if you are going to buy this, make sure the lid isn't stuck first."

I have combination skin, dry, sensitive but yet have issue with foundation lasting. I was hoping this foundation would be what I was looking for. The 'oily' version of this foundation does well of covering what I need, but sometimes I feel that version is drying. This version is NO different. While it is not drying overall, it does not stay! Slick off the face, this foundation gives what appears to be buildable when you first apply, however don't expect to check the mirror and have your foundation still on an hour later!"

I would definitely recommend this product. I generally only use high end BB creams and foundations so I was really pleased to find that this lived up to the hype!

The foundation covers up the unevenness in my skin color and helps cover up a lot of redness/darkness before i use my concealer. It has good coverage and blends alright, but it tends to come off after 4-6 hours. I use this with Nyx Studio Perfect Primer and follow it up with Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray and notice that it stays on a lot better than way. So over all it is a good foundation, but I recommend using a primer and setting spray with it!"

I have to agree this is the best lower end foundation I have used! I have been using it more then my urban decay lately.

I normally buy a full coverage foundation and I was worried this would not be enough coverage to cover up my Rosacea. I would consider this to be more of a medium coverage foundation. I have tried layering it to full coverage over a good primer and it just makes it look too cakey. So I just lightly apply a powder foundation over it in the areas I need more coverage and it looks great. I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.

The foundation doesn't have much coverage with sun spots and blemishes, although I found that it covered the natural redness of my face pretty well. The formula drys very fast and after that it's almost impossible to blend. I found that this stuck to every little hair on my face and made it prominent. It gave me dry patches on my already dry skin and if I already had a dry patch, it made it stick out like a sore thumb."

It does not emphasize my dry patches, blends wonderfully, and lasts through my 12 hrs work days. <br /><br />I apply a few swatches to my cheeks and chin and then blend it in with a Sigma F80 brush. The foundation covers my acne scarring and redness pretty well. It's also a great color match to my skin. I don't wear a power on top because I love the dewy glow it gives my face. <br /><br />I work 12 hrs so I was looking for a foundation that will not rub off but also doesn't feel heavy, and this is exactly that. I'm very pleased. I used to wear Lancome Teinte Idole Ultra but it was too expensive. This has now become my everyday foundation."

I'm super dry and sensitive and it doesn't stick to any of my dry spots or make me break out. I also have a hard time finding good colors for my skin tone because Im very fair with yellow undertones and most fair foundations have pink undertones. 150 Buff is the perfect shade and it doesn't oxidize into orange at all! Plus the coverage is one of the best I've seen from a drugstore foundation. Also if your a beauty on a budget its a little more than some but WORTH IT! I only gave 4 stars because it doesn't have a super long wear. I would say it lasts well for about 4 hours and then it may start to break up a little. But other than that AMAZING"

The coverage was so-so for me, but I used a beauty blender with it, so that definitely affected that. I also got a shade that was too pale for me. (oops) However, the big fail in this foundation for me was the way it sat on my skin. When I was putting it on it was like wiping it on plastic. It literally would not blend into my skin. It was the weirdest thing. It took forever and I had to resort to my hands and it still looked awful. throughout the day it looked dry and cakey and maybe the worst I've looked in a foundation in years. I couldn't even bring myself to give this a second try. I'm sure this works for some people, but maybe not for those with drier skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Zoe, Makeup Snob","Virginia",5,"I bought this in natural beige (I'm Greek venezuelan, so I'm a light olive, but with dark hair and eyes). The ONLY reason I bought this was because I was VERY desperate. I had NO money for makeup and my smash box BB cream (which I wear in light/neutral or light/medium) was basically dead. I have very dry, red, acne prone skin. My acne is getting better, it's mostly red and sorta pimply cheeks now. The smash box did a good job of mostly covering the acne, but I had to use a little bit of concealer for redness.<br />So I had very low expectations for this. I am a totally name brand makeup snob. I can't remember the last time I bought drug store makeup. Probably in middle school. I had actually bought this foundation a long time ago, but it stank and felt tacky. I however ended up trying it again since it was so highly rated.<br />Let me tell you, it will take a miracle foundation for me to start buy that expensive stuff again. It is the perfect amount of coverage for me, it's perfect for my dry skin, and it blends flawlessly (I use the benefit foundation brush). It looked too pink when I put it on my hand at first (I have a somewhat yellow undertone, so I use yellowish makeup), but it covered my redness really well and it looks so natural and feels weightless. I never write reviews but the moment I finished putting this on I was so impressed I sat down and immediately wrote this. <br />This is an amazing foundation. My only con would be that this might be a little to hard for beginners to use. It's a thick liquid consistency, and it might dry too fast if you aren't good at blending. I really recommend using a foundation brush."

It was also difficult to blend and I felt that it just sort of sat on top of my skin. In order for me to make this foundation work, I had to use my hands to warm it up to make it easier to blend and then I used a sponge to dab it to a smooth finish.

I was looking for something that lasted longer and maintained coverage throughout the day, and Revlon colorstay delivered. I have pretty fair skin with acne scars and redness, so coverage is always my top priority. <br />I was a little frustrated when I started applying the new foundation the first time because I was used to a foundation that blended very easily with a sponge. I found that the best way to apply this foundation is to dab it in/on with a sponge. It takes a little longer than I'm used to, but the results are absolutely worth it. <br />I actually blow dry my face after applying with cold/low air to help it settle quicker, and then apply some pur minerals pressed powder for a total matte and complete finish. <br />I've found that it lasts ALL day for me with no redness or splotchiness, and I have a job where I end up sweating for about 5 hours a day on average if not longer lol. <br />If you're looking for something that lasts with AMAZING coverage and is a very reasonable price, seriously look no further.

Not too heavy or lightweight, just perfect! Stays on all day, its gives a matte finish.  Looking for a smiliar product to name brand! This product is for you..."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","lcca","Los Angeles, CA",5,"I typically buy &quot;name brand&quot; liquid foundation like Japonesque, Juicy, Bare Minerals. I only bought a bottle of this because there was a sale and I need to pinch pennies for the time being. I. Am. Amazed. I don't remember if I used to use this product in the past, but it goes on very light-weight, stays on ALL DAY. So far, I haven't noticed if it rubs off on clothing like my previous brands. It is easy to apply with a brush (no streaks or swirls in the finish), but I go over trouble spots a second time with finger tapping. My skin is really difficult to cover up blemishes/scars because of natural red pigment, but this foundation really provides full coverage without getting cakey or adding strange texture to the finish. I may have bought this because it was pretty cheap, but excluding truly high end foundations (e.g. Nars), I plan on sticking with this!!"

It stays on all day and doesn't get all over my clothes, scarves, etc. I have very light skin so it is hard to find a foundation that works with my skin tone but this foundation is perfect! I have freckles and this foundation evens out my skin tone without hiding them!! <br />Pro Tip: Use a makeup sponge to apply and it looks almost airbrushed!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Christina T","Las Vegas, NV",4,"I recommend light coverage. My skin dries out and this tends to flake around my nose if it is too heavy. Great pigment and easy to apply. Even with light application, it will still hide blemishes throughout the day."

I wish it was full coverage like the Kat Von D Lock It foundation that I use on my oily patches, but I still love it regardless. I will continue to buy this."

It stays on with full coverage. To refresh if going out in the evening I take a warm wash cloth and lightly lay it on my face and it is a if I just reapplied. Freshen up powder only on my nose and tip of chin, fresh lipstick and I'm ready for a night out."

It's a nice full coverage product without being heavy and cakey. it covers blemishes and some freckles without looking cakey and heavy. For winter I switch to combo/dry skin in a lighter shade then summer switch to combo/oily in a slightly darker shade. I've tried other more expensive brands and have always returned them to go back to revlon colorstay."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Melanie","Oklahoma",4,"I use this product daily on top of my moisturizer and the thing that stands out to me is that I don't get greasier throughout the day--which is a definite plus because I am prone to breakouts and like to wear as little product as I can get away with. This product stays put, although I do end up adding a little more on my problem areas and under my eyes throughout the day. In comparison to other products, I break out much, much less using Revlon Colorstay than I have with the gambit of other makeups I tried for longer periods--like Covergirl."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","Daisy","NSW",5,"I have VERY dry skin and this is great as it doesn't cling as much to my dry patches. Its getting into summer so my skin isn't quite so dry (although it is still very dry) and it covers well without patches forming on dry spots. (note: I moisturise with olive oil before hand to get rid of bad flakey skin).<br />I use a sponge and get good coverage. Lightens red acne spots and scars. Good for getting rid of the purple colour under my eyes. <br />With this product (and olive oil) I finally think I can wear make-up to my formal. Very happy."

The only downside is that it dries pretty quickly so you have to blend fast, but this isn't too much of a problem. I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a problem with this foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-makeup-normaldry-skin-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod1810159","jwalker","Birmingham",5,"Wore pricey brands from Dept Stores most of my life.  I do not notice a difference. I live in a humid climate. The ColorStay line does not smear or rub off.  The eyeliner is the only one I have found that doesn't result in raccoon eyes."
