They apply easily with either a sponge or fingers and do blend well.  The rose is more saturated and intense than the coral color and takes less product to get total color on the cheeks.  II'm giving up all powder cosmetics due to fine lines so I have an entire drawer full of cream blushes and these get used more often than my Tarte Cheek Stain (too greasy) or my other drug store brands (too sheer).  I recommend them, if these colors will work for you.  The pan is large, you get a LOT of product for the price."

"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Quilter one","Cape Cod Ma.",4,"Good color for me and smoothes on easily!"
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","thehoney","TN",2,"I was hoping this would be similar to Stila's Convertible Color, but it's not. It doesn't have enough &quot;slip&quot; to it, which means when I apply lightly with my fingers, it drags my foundation off right where I need it the most. (Melasma). Color range is minimal and too bright."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Alice","Cleveland OH",4,"Like the product, need softer colors"
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","KTO","Littleton, co",5,"So light and smooth easy to apply and looks great without being greasy. Doesn't give me acne. It is so much better than any other cream blush I've tried!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Kismet","Atlanta, GA",4,"In addition to cheeks, Shade 150 Charmed Enchantment also works well as a very natural your-lips-but-better stain that can be worn alone or as a foundation for lip color.  This product is highly pigmented, so a little goes a very long way; I find it's easier to apply to the face by patting it on.  Not at all glittery, which is perfect for a subtle look.<br /><br />Great value for the money."

"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","JoAnn the mediator","mandeville La",4,"Only blush that dos not clog pores. looks natural."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","xyxxxxxx","NJ",4,"The best blush I've ever used and this is coming from someone who normally uses Nars, Tarte, Smashbox, Urban Decay etc.  It is aweseome and that's really all there is to say!  I will never buy another &quot;high end&quot; blush again.  My only wish is that they had a bigger color selection.  Right now, it looks like only four colors are being regularly produced and sold. I have it in Charmed Enchantment.  Not red, not pink.  I would describe it as a dark rose.  Goes on smoothly under or over make-up and stays put.  Easy to apply and gives a natural glow.  Doesn't make my already &quot;rosacea&quot;-looking skin look worse.  Wish they still made it in Rose Glow because that one got rave reviews and it was discontinued."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Carmels","Chicago suburb",5,"more color choices."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Carol","Arlington Hts., IL",5,"Very happy with this Cream Blush. It blends easily and looks natural. I prefer this type of blush over the powder, it seems to last longer."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","mitzi go shop","Florence, AL",5,"I have tried many blushes in the past.  A friend had used this Revlon blush for a pretty long time and told me to try it.  I did and now this all I will use.  Love the color.  Very natural, not to red or to pink."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Mom","Henderson nevada",5,"It blends with your skin tone"
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Suebeach","Jensen Beach, FL",5,"Found this product to be the perfect cheek stain for a natural look.  It is not greasy as others I have tried.  I tan and chose the &quot;Charmed Enchantment&quot; color.  Works for richer skin tones."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","JH","Alexandria, LA",3,"Daily makeup application"
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","R.","NJ",3,"I love this blush for the ease of application and the way it works with sensitive and aging skin. It's smooth and creamy. At some point, Revlon pulled most of it from the stores because it took 2 months to find it again. The problem with this blush is that it doesn't stay on, despite the name. As beautifully as it blends, you have to use a bit more to get it to show and stay. I wear an all natural type of look, so applying that much make up is more than I like."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Bchlubber","The Woodlands, TX",5,"I am usually not a fan of cream blush but decided to give this one a try.  So glad I did - it will now be one of my favorite blushes.  Goes on smooth and blends well.  Provides a very natural look.  The color in the pot is deceiving because it looks different on your skin.  I did use it over a liquid foundation.  Not sure how well it will blend with a powder foundation."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Sheena","Kennett Square",5,"Hard to find cream blushes anymore!  Much preferred to powders."

"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Cee Tee","Eldersburg",1,"The shade was too light for my complexion."
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","R.","NJ",4,"I've been using a different pigment of this blush for awhile but with summer coming I needed a change. I chose the nude and it's perfect! It does exactly what I need for my everyday summer look!"
"http://www.ulta.com/cream-blush?productId=xlsImpprod6320740","Soda Girl","Williamsburg, VA",5,"I had tried several different brands of cream blush, ranging from prestigious to everyday popular brands, but this one worked best for my skin complexion and condition.  So glad that it is reasonably priced and available at Ulta."
