"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Jeane","California",5,"I tend to have dry lips generally, this product does not dry out my lips! Its stays on through eating, drinking, even brushing teeth!    Use your eye make up remove to take it off, comes off easily with eye make up remover no big deal as some others have stated.  If you just want to add a little color to your lips that looks super natural try the Bare Maximum"

Only issue I have is that it is much brighter (and lighter) pink than it appears in tube. I need to blend it with another, darker, color to make it work for my skin tone and age."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Chicstreet","Newhall, CA",4,"My girlfriend recommended this to me after I complained about leaving lipstick stains on wine glasses.  I love this product in that it does not do that ever.  It stays on all day and looks fabulous.  It is drying however so I moisturize my lips at night when home."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","sleepy bitd","iowa",5,"This stuff is amazing! Lasts all day and doesn't dry out my lips. I have a hard time even finding lip balms that don't dry my lips so this is pretty incredible! I have worn this thru a fried chicken dinner and on another occasion thru tacos! If you don't reapply the gloss, it will feel tacky, but the color still doesn't lift. Can also be layered with other glosses. I layer my Buxom lip polishes over the top and it still wears like iron. At the end of the day a little coconut oil helps remove it. Out performs lippies that cost twice as much. I highly recommend."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Kachinka","Ocala, FL",5,"Love, love, love Revlon ColorStay Overtime Lip Color.  I buy this with a matching lip liner.  Stays on my lips for a very long time.  Sometimes I don't have to re apply.  It's the only lip color I where when I'll be out all day long.  My lips feel great too.....they never get chapped or dry.  With so many colors to choose from I can have many looks.  Revlons lip liner works well with this."

I don't care for the slightly shiny colors as they do tend to have some clumping.   Also, it should only be applied in the am as continued application throughout the day will result in clumping and stickiness."

No other formula compares, I have many shades of these from light to dark and they're all unique in color and it's transfer proof, it doesn't have a scent when applying either. They last all day from 7:00 am to midnight without smudging, just make sure it dries down completely before applying gloss. 10/10 would recommend"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Donna","Denver, CO",5,"I use it with lip liner, apply the color, blot, and finish with the gloss.  It lasts for hours and hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Sara","Haverhill, Ma",5,"Love the color and the fact that it's long lasting. Using this for a wedding and had to do a test run. Wore very well with no smudging. The only downside it it does dry out, however if you use a basic lip balm vrs the gloss that is provided it definitely helps. Would recommend this product to friends."

Some greasy foods will take it off, too.  Clear gloss top coat needs touch up after eating &amp; drinking.  Once I paint it on in front of my mirror, I can re-gloss with my eyes closed anywhere, no mirror needed."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Sue in the OP","Chicago",4,"I've been using this brand for years, and I'm still not disappointed with it.  It doesn't stay on indefinitely (it's not a tattoo, after all), but it stays on all day at work.  That includes staying on through multiple cups of tea and the occasional snack.  It doesn't look as good at 12 as it did at 7, but it's still showing color.  If I had any complaint, it would be that there could be a bit more of the gloss in the tube.  It runs out quickly, and I only use it once during the day."

I had also stopped wearing lipstick for some reason. And now that I have decided to start wearing it again, I have had a heard time finding the right color, I picked this up because I liked the color. I was surprised when I put it on and the color looked great on me. It also stayed on all day. I just had to touch up the gloss. I even went to bed with it on and it stayed on all night. I love it. That is always a pet peeve when my lipstick does not stay on long.  I will definitely be buying this again."

This is the category of lipwear that is a two step application. First before any lipwear goes on my lips i pre - moisturize with something that is free of oils. Then, I apply lipcolor. then wait about a minute while it drys. Its dry when it can not stick to your finger. Then apply gloss to finish it! The only reapplication i have to do all day is the gloss to refresh it! Good job revlon!"

Once the gloss wears off, you have to reapply it over and over or else your lips get very dry.  I'm not usually a fan og gloss because it's sticky, but the length of time the color stays on is worth it. I can go out at night and know that my lips won't fade."

She told me it was Revlon Colorstay Overtime and that she had been wearing it for years, so I tried it.  The colors are pretty and the stain part does stay on well but is very drying so you are constantly re-applying the lip gloss and it is a little sticky. Consequently I only use it when I need all day (or night!) color but not necessarily every day."

They don't fill the color side up very much.  Have to keep buying more containers too often.

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Queen","Cincinnati, Oh",5,"I have always been looking for a lipstick that stays put even after eating and drinking. Once this liquid lipstick dries, it won't even bleed or wear off. I use makeup remover to take it off before bed. The color palate they offer is wide range from intense reds to natural nudes. It is wonderful to have your lipstick applied once and look as good as when you put it on many hours earlier."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-overtime-lip-color?productId=fs797198","Fine Wine","Spokane, WA",4,"Purchased this in Ultimate Wine, expecting a dark red with maybe a little bit of plum tone - instead it turned out to be a fireengine red! Glad I tried it out on a night when I was staying in, because this color is going no-where once it gets on your lips. I was horrified by the color and tried to get it off (after I let it dry and put on the gloss, of course!) For those of you who like fireengine red lips, this color goes on smoothly, feels good on the lips, and the gloss adds a lovely finish.<br /><br />This lip color withstood scrubbing with hot water, soap, toothpaste, and coconut oil without flaking, rubbing, or diminishing in color intensity. Finally was able to get it off the next morning in the shower! <br /><br />A++ for lasting power, will definitely try this in another color (but make sure that I have 16 hours before I have to face the world, just in case)."

They are a bit drying if you aren't reapplying the gloss often, but it's not horrible. I did find that the color lasts ALL DAY and only transferred a teeny bit (nothing noticeable). The one thing I will say I don't like about these, is after being on the lips for more than 6+ hours, it does start to feel a little gritty.

It lasts about 7 hours for me. Then I have to remove completely (with makeup remover) and reapply. You will have to frequently apply the clear topcoat throughout the day to keep your lips feeling moist and not tacky. But I would rather apply the clear topcoat than have to redo my previous lipstick numerous times a day.<br />NOTE: Don't try to use something else instead of the clear topcoat that comes with the lip color. I did, and it made the lip color come off.<br />Overall, a very good product and I would highly recommend it!"

It is a medium color on my complexion (I have red/blonde hair, blue-green eyes and a fair complexion).  This should be a color that works well for a wide range of complexions.  I get a lot of compliments on my lip color.  For me, this product literally lasts all day.  It looks nearly as good when I'm getting ready for bed as it does when I put it on in the morning!  If you eat oily foods, you can expect the product to come off.  Prior to applying the product I always carefully buff my lips with a mild cleanser and damp wash cloth to remove any flaky skin and/or oils.  After my lips are dry, I carefully apply the lip color.  You want to take your time with this process to get the color on evenly and to ensure your lip shape looks right.  Then wait for the color to dry (I usually wait 2-3 minutes) before using the gloss.  An added bonus... my boyfriend loves that he can kiss me without any color transfer!"

The clear gloss is thin, and not sticky at all. The staying power is amazing. I only have to reapply the clear gloss after eating or drinking. The color stays in place, and still looks good even when the gloss has worn off. I have bought about half of the colors in this collection. I love them all. I have everything from a soft pink to the dramatic scarlet. I always get compliments when I wear any of the colors. The one thing I would suggest is to buy a small container of old fashion cold cream. The stain does not come off with regular face wash or make up removers. The packaging recommends this too.

It's very true to color, goes on smoothly, never flakes off, and lasts all day.  In fact, I once had a dentist ask me to remove my lipcolor, so he wouldn't smear it, and I'm not sure he believed me when I said it was impossible.  A couple hours of dental work later, and my lipstick was just as perfect as when I'd put it on that morning.  The included gloss is something I don't often use -- I just don't like the feel of gloss in general.  But it's nice to have if my lips are feeling a bit dry (rarely), or I want a bit of shine.<br /><br />The Boundless Brandy color is absolutely perfect for me.  The natural look doesn't really work for me, and this is one of the few colors I've found that isn't too much for wearing to work but also looks great when I dress up.  If Revlon ever discontinues it, I may have to stop going out in public."

You'll see YouTubers with mixed reviews, but generally saying it's amazing if you keep it moisturized. You'll test it the night before a big party and it'll be great for that hour long test. Then you'll go to a fancy company party with loads of mingling and you'll look amazing (you exfoliated and followed the directions, after all)...until 45 mins in and you're mid-girl talk with a coworkers wife and you just feel your lips drying up, cracking, dissolving into sticky goopy globs on your lips. You'll excuse yourself to the bathroom to find your lips are AWFUL. Cracked, goopy, terrible. You'll scrub vigorously to get what you can off and then reapply, because once you go bold you can't walk back out bare lipped. But you'll know full well no human on earth has the ability to reapply the gloss or chapstick every 5 minutes to keep this stuff looking okay, so you know you'll be back scrubbing and reapplying in 45 minutes. Then you'll check your teeth on the way home and see tons of the globs all over your teeth and die of embarrassment not knowing when those globs got on your teeth. Was it before or after you smiled wide while shmoozing all the higher ups? You will be miserable. You will be bummed. You will vow &quot;never again&quot;. Do. Not. Buy. This."

I have also realized when products promise long lasting wear, especially with Revlon, you have to exfoliate your lips so the dead skin cells don't allow the product to clump and separate. I did just that. Prior to wearing it, I exfoliate my lips, made sure they were moisturized but at the same time there wasn't much chap stick. Once I put it on, I had hope but then within an hour, it started to clamp up on my lips, the lip gloss would clump up together and after I reapplied, it wouldn't stay all over. I had to take it out all together and apply lipstick that wasn't long lasting."

I have bought it many times because I LOVE the color Infinite Raspberry and it lasts longer than lipgloss/lipstick. It DEFINITELY does not last 16 hours. If you eat, drink, etc. there is just no way it lasts that long. I apply chapstick throughout the day, which I know contributes to the wearing off of the lip color, but even without doing that, it can get patchy when it starts to wear off on its own. It's also pretty inexpensive so although its not the best quality out there, I like the color and the price so i will likely keep purchasing."

As someone who drinks coffee and water all day, this is the perfect product for me! There are some cons, however! It's very hard to get off! My makeup removing wipes did not work at taking this off and aren't really made for lips! How to remove: apply Vaseline, leave on for about five minutes, and then rub it off with something rough like a paper towel. It sometimes takes 2-3 times doing this to get it off completely. I recommend applying chapstick after removal. Removing this lip gloss will be tough for people with sensitive lips, and the gloss itself burns a bit on sensitive lips. Application is time consuming. It doesn't exactly go on evenly so it takes some patience to get it right. If too much is applied, it feels like glue, and will start peeling off. Try it for the first time on a day when you aren't in a rush or aren't going out so that you have time to get used to the process. Your lips will feel dry while it is on but will not appear dry. The ability to stay on, though, makes the product 100% worth any struggle it may cause!"

This stuff probably has a silicone base, is totally kissable, doesn't rub off, feels a little sticky, but totally worth it! I am in love! It says it needs to be removed with an oil-based makeup remover. I used Mary Kay oil-free makeup remover and it did the trick! This is kissable &amp; can eat &amp; drink, but if you eat greasy, you may need to reapply, and if you bite your lip (or someone else does), this lip color could end up on your teeth.

True Chocolate has a nice reddish undertone, and stays on fairly well.  Stay Currant, however, REALLY lasts all day, even when you eat something like tacos for lunch.  I apply in thin layers, like nail polish, blotting lightly between coats but not letting it dry fully.  I don't generally use the shiny topcoat, as I don't like sticky things on my lips (my hair blows around and gets stuck and ewwww).  My skin is pretty oily, and my lips almost never get really dry, so if you have easily-chapped lips, you might not like this.

I can't stand traditional matte liquid lipsticks but I want bold color that lasts a long time and won't transfer outside my lips.  This is perfect!  My mom has used this for years and until recently, I never understood why but it is a trusted and true product if you want lip color that won't budge throughout the day.  You have to top it with the gloss though because the formula is very drying but the gloss looks great and holds the color in place.  So comfortable to wear!  My only complaint is that it's hard to remove, but I guess if you're looking for a lip product with staying power then that's what you want."

Two coats will actually last through dinner &amp; through the night if you don't take it off with makeup remover!  By far the best long wear lipstick in terms of staying power I've found.

The only thing I will say is that they often look like a different color in the bottle than when they are on.
