"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Bernie","Phoenix AZ",1,"I wasn't pleased with the sharpener.  It didn't give a good point to my eyebrow pencil."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Amandabrilz","Baltimore, md",3,"Works well but the bigger side wasn't the size I was looking for"
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Kayholla","Atlanta, Ga",4,"I use it to sharpen my eye and lip liners."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Jane","Charlotte, NC",5,"This sharpener works great.  Doesn't shred my eyeliner pencil like my old one."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Baby B","Chicago,IL",5,"This sharpener is a great tool. I love the little compartment that retains the shavers.  This can be used anywhere."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Littlered","Thornton, Co",3,"Even works after I dropped it. I like the fact that I can use it with larger pencils when I need to do so."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Kelsey","Aurora, Colorado",2,"I bought this sharpener for my Smashbox Eyeliner and my Two Faced lip liner. I figured the cheaper the better how bad could a sharpener be? It never has my pencils sharp and makes the wooden parts jagged and that tends to stab you in the eye or lip. Also when I'm sharpening something the top will pop off and the shavings will go everywhere. You get what you pay for, it technically works just not well. I would spend a few more dollars on a good sharpener."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","FoxyG","Sacramento, CA",5,"It's my second time purchasing this sharpener. I bought my first one 10 years ago and it broke recently and I searched every where until I found it again. It's the best!"
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","tatiananana","CA",4,"I used it for a plastic liner &amp; a wooden liner.  It sharpened both very easily &amp; the sharpener itself was easy to clean"
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Janay","Houston, TX",5,"I had lost my eye pencil sharpener that I had forever (so long that I couldn't even see the brand name on it). So I went to ULTA to find a replacement. I usually like Revlon products because they are a good quality and affordable. This product is no different."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","artsy receptionist","pa",4,"The sharpen bits of any and all pencils fill the area where the shavings go fast. Empty instantly or sharpen with lid off to not clog the device."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Jay","San Francisco, ca",5,"Easy to use, gets the job done, and is afforable! A win in my book."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","TLEM88","Flower Mound, Texas",5,"Nice compact size that will sharpener multiple sizes and keep the shavings until you can dispose. I have used others that &quot;chew&quot; into liner pencils. Ulta's house brand is good too, but this one is a little more compact. Great to keep in your travel bag for the gym or trips or freshening up when going out."

"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","Middleagemom","Roseville, MN",1,"I purchased this Revlon Universal Points Sharpener. I was looking for something to use to sharpen my Ulta eye crayons. The largest hole on the Revlon sharpener was too small. I took it back to the store; an employee was very helpful and I was able to exchange this product for an Ulta sharpener that works well."

"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","4J Mom","Lubbock, Texas",3,"Not much to review about a sharpener, but here goes:  It's good and sharp, and does well with all sizes of makeup pencils, but the darned cover will not stay on and it makes a mess of the drawer unless you empty and clean it every time."
"http://www.ulta.com/universal-points-sharpener?productId=xlsImpprod3520045","M","TX",5,"Like the multi pencil sizes sharpener and the shavings receptacle."
