It was a huge mess under my foundation and took forever to dry/set. For the price of the product and how bad it is I would never purchase this again."

It did nothing to help feminist the flings on forehead whatsoever. The only way this product would be of any use is 1) you have to be in your 20's, and/or 2) you need to have Botox pumped into your forehead such as Gwen Steffani. Don't waste your money. The only thing good out of the product was I could return it."
