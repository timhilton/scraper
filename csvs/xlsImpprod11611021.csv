I don't like the brush applicator, would prefer a sponge. It glides on and it mositerizes my lips. Wish it would last longer. It does fit in my pants pocket nicely, to keep with me all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","L","Fort Myers, FL",3,"I bought this gloss in Pink Ruby, and I was very excited to try it out. I have used it a couple times for work and daily use. I find the texture once on to feel rubbery, though very pigmented. I will use this gloss until it's gone, but I don't think I would repurchase. Not a fan of the texture, and it does transfer."

They really are HD.Leaves a nice stain behind after wearing off, but does stay glossy for a long time.They' held up through all my Vegas partying.They absolutely are comparable to high end lipglosses.They're true to color and very pigmented.Have recommended to many of my friends!"

I didn't like it at all but if you like really pink...this is for you. I tried to wipe it off immediately after I applied it and nope....it stained my lips so I would say it will stay for awhile. I will try it in another color."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Col515","Brunswick, GA",2,"I didn't like the applicator,  the brush bristles clumped together which made it hard to apply.  I got the product on my fingers.  It was sticky too. However, I really like the color.  I would prefer a wand applicator without bristles."

I never got to test this product. However I did buy two others and I adore the formula and color. The brown I brought ended up being the perfect nude lip color. The orange was pigmented enough to not be over bearing. So I did enjoy those. But because the red one was used I have to give it 1 star."

This gloss didn't have that weird sticky tar feeling or a horrid taste on my lips. The applicator was a easy lip brush and the color was perfect. No sticky feeling or mess. I just love this HD shine it makes the color pop out."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Jade","Austin, Texas",5,"I am not a fan of sticky, lip glosses. However, this is more like a liquid lipstick with a shine. I am fair, wish there were more natural, nude/pink hues. Ads just enough to make your lips look plump. I have worn it over a matte lipstick, works without being thick or gooey."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Jules","Ohio",5,"Very pretty gloss that I wear over my darker lipsticks to lighten and shine. I have very dry lips and it is very moisturizing"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","CamiS","Chandler, AZ",4,"Favorite shade of pink, not too dark, not too light, just perfect. Thick and moisturizing. Smells a bit chemically, but very faint smell.<br />My only complain is that the sparkles in it end up all over my face, not only on my chin but literally all over my skin. I like the brush (not like a spongy thing, but rather like a nail polish brush) which allows to pull out of the tube more product than a spongy brush."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Liz","Pittsburgh, PA",5,"I didn't mind the bright color of this because that's how I like my pink lip colors. I bought this in Tourmaline. It's awesome. It also stains your lips a bit when it wears off. It's a near perfect pink lipgloss in my opinion and I will likely buy a few back ups because I like it so much."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","MrsLSB","Chicago",5,"Revlon discontinued the lip gloss that I was using and they finally came out with one that is comparable. I'm not overly impressed with the applicator but I'll deal with it."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","arcadiarose","Portland, OR USA",5,"I have these in Tourmaline, Pink Ruby, and Smoky Quartz.  They are absolutely stunning, and I'm going to buy more colors.  These are highly pigmented, with lots of depth of color and sparkle.  They last a very long time, and these three bright/dark colors stain the lips slightly.  They have a light scent, with no discernible scent/taste once applied.<br /><br />The applicator brush works pretty well.  I usually press my lips together slightly after applying, to help even the gloss out more.  I recommend a lipliner with the bright/dark shades to help prevent migrating."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Livia","Kansas",2,"I love Revlon's balm stains, so I was eager to try this HD lacquer product. I chose Petalite, a beautiful pink. Sadly, the applicator stick comes out covered in gloppy product, more of it seeped out of the container when I tried to put the cap back on. It's a mess. I would tolerate poor packaging if the product itself were good, but it's nothing more than a lip gloss. It is quite sheer, the color is barely there, and it slips and transfers off almost immediately. Revlon does many things well. This isn't one of them."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Brendny","New York",4,"I recently got these lip lacquer in 3 colors: smokey topaz, petaline (nude-natural pink shades) and sunstone (that is more like orange-coral, beautiful color perfect for summer) all of them are nice, not sticky but this gloss is nothing out of this world but I would say that is a very decent product."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","wren knee","Houston",4,"Lots of compliments on this lip color!"
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","viv","n/a",5,"I love this lip gloss, I actually prefer the brush over sponge, (you need to wipe off excess in the rim before applying, for those who are complaining).  <br />the brush makes application more smooth and even.  I have like 5 of these glosses, and I really love the rose quartz shade, its like a mlbb type shade"

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Queenbee","Minneapolis, Mn.",1,"I will never purchase this product again. the application has a brush and not a sponge type stick. This stuff smears all over the place when eating or drinking, then makes you look like a clown. That defeats the purpose of beauty. I'd like a refund since I bought two! Never again."

The color is very very bright vivid pink and it stays on a long time. It doesn't taste great and it is a little sticky, so if you're a lip licker, it's probably not for you. Otherwise, enjoy!"

The F1re Opal shows up orange and the Pink Ruby shows up pinkish purple. This product does not apply smoothly; it is thick and it slides off my lips onto the skin above and below."

They are not drying, they smell subtle and nice, look very flattering and are super long lasting. I have the petalite which is a coraly pink but not too flashy, with a warm undertone/golden sheen (not glittery). And I also have Smokey Topaz which is amazing! It has become one of my favorites and Im positive it would look good with any skintone."

It goes on super thick and a little clumpy but once its on and smoothed out I love it! They stay red for hours. The glossiness wears away but the color itself does stay."
"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Alyssa","Chicago",1,"This clung to the dry patches on my lip and was opaque in some places and translucent in others. Taking back on my next trip to ultra. I tried it because a YouTube beauty blogger loved them but maybe these only look good in lips that aren't dry. (If anyone has any reccommendations on how to seriously fix my constantly dry and peeling lips, please do share!)"

I like a good color, this one delivers.  I like my lip gloss but not too runny to get into the creases around my mouth, this one does that.  It has a pretty shine and it makes my lips stay soft.  Wish it had a better taste for my date, but it still looks nice and lasts long.  I like the new packaging too with the crystal on the lid, good job with that Revlon. Thanks."

I have almost the exact color in a Maybeline gloss that just disappears so quickly! I happened to come by this Revlon in the same gorgeous color and figured I'd give it a try! SO glad i did. This one is not quite as sticky and actually stays pretty bright pink for a few hours and doesn't just fade away. Also i only need one swipe of this and rub my lips together so the product lasts WAY longer than any other lip gloss. Had to write a review on this. Love it and glad i found it."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-hd-lip-lacquer?productId=xlsImpprod11611021","Lipstick Lady","Wisconsin",5,"I bought the lipstick thinking it would blend in like a gloss, but it stays on strong like a lipstick! I ate and drank, and I still had it on at the end of the work day. Exactly true to color. The only caveat is that if you have dry lips, the end of the day it tends to sink in the lines. I don't mind this because you can't see it unless you're 2 inches from my face. I would suggest putting chapstick under it if that bothers you. Absolutely LOVE."

The tube is small and convenient and doesn't get messy in my bag the way some glosses do. There is no overwhelming scent. No overwhelming stickiness. My hair didn't get stuck in it...that is my &quot;overwhelmingly sticky&quot; gauge. Applied normally the colors are VERY true to the tube. I have olive toned, medium (NC35) skin that usually makes everything read browner than expected and neutralizes bright shades so this is really nice. It is versatile because if applied thinly it's a comfortable wash of color and stays put well. I will buy more colors."

I bought applicators to use and I tried it myself and I've never taken off lipgloss so quickly in my life. I would definitely not buy this again."
