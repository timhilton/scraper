I have to apply a few coats but not clumpy and stays on all day. Might not want to use going out as it is not dark enough."

"http://www.ulta.com/ultra-volume-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541021","Christine","Hicksville, NY",5,"I was so upset to learn that Revlon discontinued their 3D PhotoReady mascara; I had been using it for years! In the past week, I had tried 3 new mascaras, none of which gave my naturally long eyelashes the volume that my old mascara had. I was skeptical purchasing this mascara, since it wasn't my usual PhotoReady one, but I decided to give it a shot since it was Revlon. I'm SO happy with my decision. Like I said earlier, my eyelashes are already naturally long, so I don't need the extra length, but this product definitely delivers the volume I was looking for without giving my eyelashes that &quot;spider&quot; look. If you pick at your mascara, it WILL flake - but if you leave it alone, it will be fine. It clumps a little bit the more coats you use, but if you use an eyelash brush or comb, the clumps are easy to get rid of. The tube itself is a little weird to hold because of its shape, but that's obviously not going to deter me from repurchasing! Overall, I love this mascara and I'm happy I gave Revlon a second chance!"
