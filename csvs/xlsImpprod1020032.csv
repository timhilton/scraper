How ever, the texture looks odd once applied. It makes your lips looked chapped even if they aren't. I even tried applying lip balm before using the lipstick and still got the same effect. If the formula was different this lipstick would be a great dupe for department store brands, but unfortunately it has the grade quality of the average drugstore brand."

Too light looked like I was sick with noooo lips. It wears off too fast. Did not like it, maybe another color could be better. Don't know."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Jumbo","Florida",4,"I have been looking for the perfect nude lipstick for a while and then I was introduced to Nude Attitude. I thought it was perfect! The only thing I didn't like was it wore off really easily... But other than that, I would recommend it for anybody. And, the price is right!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","KPEP10","Oswego",2,"Bought this color because it looks just like Mac's cream D' nude lipstick. The color goes on just like Mac, but after about 20 mins check your lips because the color ends up at the corners of your mouth! You have to reapply often to keep the color on lips."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Colby Dane","Phoenix, AZ",5,"I actually bought this as a Christmas present for my best friend because I loved it so much and she said that she loved it on me!"

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Jane","Arizona",4,"Purchased #006 matte red. Great color that goes on smoothly and looks great alone or with clear or red gloss on top.<br /><br />If you've been searching for a red that doesn't go pink as it wears off or when you wear just a little bit, this is a fantastic choice."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Stef Cue","Nyc",5,"True to color! Can't get enough... I get compliments everytime I go out!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","kcoto","tampa,fl",5,"great color and since they are a fraction of the cost you can buy way more and try out different looks"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Sall2032","Nashville, TN",3,"I liked the matte-ness of this lipstick, but I thought I would have a more bright orange color than this. Good lipstick, just not the color I was expecting"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Christina","Raleigh, NC",4,"I bought this after watching tutorials on YouTube and hearing all of the hype. I don't wear lipstick EVER but I thought I'd try this. I LOVE IT! Yes, as other reviews said it is clumpy, and settles into the lines of your lips. You must not have dry lips, use chapstick under it, and if you want a shine instead of the matte look, wear lip gloss over it. Overall, it's the first lipstick I've really loved.<br /><br />I bought it in &quot;Nude Attitude&quot;"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","wendigoal","Montgomery, AL",4,"I had not bought a matte lipstick before so I wasn't sure what to expect. It is creamier than I expected; not too dry, although drier than most traditional, more glossy lipsticks. But I guess that's the point. I got it in &quot;Really Red,&quot; so it's probably more suited to a special occasion / going out for most people, but I tend to wear bold red lipstick a lot anyway, so I use it for everyday as well. My concern with buying red lipsticks is they can tend to go too bright on me. This one is pretty true to what you see in the tube. It stays in place pretty well. The only reason I didn't rate it &quot;perfect&quot; is because I haven't tried any other matte lipsticks so I have nothing to compare it to."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Tay","Owensboro, KY",4,"It gives a great base to a lip gloss, and looks natural."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Kendra_CD","NY",5,"I wear this every day now and it adds a very natural look to the lips without the shine.<br />And it would also be a very nice selection to add for the unisex male users."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","queen","philadalphia,pa",5,"I love this lipstick! although it's not that bright of a pink i still love it."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Rosa","Springville, NY",2,"It looked like a pretty soft pink, but I would have liked a more saturating lipstick with more creaminess.  My lips felt dry and looked kind of hum drum"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","ultashopper","allen park, michigan",4,"the quality was great, but the color was a little different than shown on the tube. Was not flattering for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","DollFace","Omaha, NE",1,"The color settles in the creases of my lips. It's pretty clumpy, and doesn't look smooth once it's on."

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Vicky","Elmont, NY",5,"I purchased Revlon Matte Lipstick in the past [pink pout, sky pink] I really loved these lipsticks their true to color but some can be a little drying and you have to apply lip gloss over it. I recently purchased Smoky Peach, Nude attitude, and Stormy Pink there awesome ! Nude attitude is more for light/medium toned. Stormy Pink and Smoky Peach can vary. Definitely will purchase more in the future*"

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Aida","Phoenix, AZ",4,"I got this lipstick yesterday and I already love it! I love the nude lipstick look and this is a great pick. It's a matte style, so if you want a little shine, put a dab of lipgloss on and it looks perfect!<br /><br />It looks a little orangey in the picture, but it isn't. I was worried at first when I bought it but very pleased with the color when it arrived."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Joyfriendz","Northbrook, IL",5,"Good dupe for MAC Kinda Sexy lipstick, but is a bit more peach toned.  Doesn't last as long as MAC, but is creamier and less drying.  Color is not Mauve at all despite its name. More of a peachy-pink nude."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","MarshaS","Bay Area",5,"This is my lips but better...Love this color!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Elliphant","Washington D.C.",1,"I was looking for a nude to go with my very, very pale skin so I bought nude attitude, not really knowing the color I was going to get. Mistake! My lips are very red naturally, so it wore like orange on me. My lips are also dry, and the application was so uneven that it emphasized all the dry and cracked spots. I tried mixing it with other lipsticks and lip glosses but nothing worked. By far one of the worst lipsticks in my collection."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Shipra","New Delhi, India",4,"Smoked Peach is one of most lovely lip color in my stash! I love the matte finish, smooth and even application, the warm peachy shade and the overall performance of this lip color. it certainly is my most picked lip color!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","kat","Burbank,Ca",2,"I didn't like this matte lipstick at all when applying it's over drying on my lips I have to have a nice smooth sheer lipstick if I want it to really stick on my lips not buying anymore of these."

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Samantha723","Middletown, Rhode Island",4,"I have this in pink pout, it was highly recommended by youtube vloggers. When I put it on I noticed it built up on dry spots on my lips, so make sure to exfoliate them before using. I also didn't use a lip liner, and it definitly feathered. I don't own any lip liners so I'll definitly need to get one because I love this lip product. The color is great on it's own or layer with other similar colors."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Genevieve","Chicago",3,"I love the velvet finish of this lipstick and the color sky pink is so pretty. But I really don't like it that it's way too dry on my lisps!! This one may be used sometime in summer or when the weather is more like humid. Anyway it worth the price."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Hannah","Miami",5,"Love this pop of color for an everyday look! This lipstick made me become obsessed with corals!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Brianna","Fontana, CA",4,"I love the color especially with brown tone eye shadows. It does tend to wear off."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Jvang","Minneapolis",5,"This is my favorite color from Revlon's Matte line. It has the perfect neutral lip color. My lips are naturally dark and so I have a hard time finding neutral to nude lip wear and this lipstick gives me the exact color I want. Was very happy when I found it at Ulta because I can't find it anywhere anymore."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Zauthentic4","Atlanta, Georgia",5,"I am medium brown skin African American and bought stormy pink. It looks great on darker skin tones. I love matte lipcolor!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Drea","Everett, WA",4,"I got this in Smoky Peach. It's too light for me unfortunately, but I can wear it lightly at least or mix or layer. Revlon lipsticks are great for the price. They're pigmented and high quality for drugstore makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Plain Jane","Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,"I've been trying to get out of my box and use trendy colors but alas my neutral/classic look always wins. I've been eyeing this color for awhile and finally bought it. It's a pretty pink that can be used at any time. I used a lip primer and a NYX lip liner along with it to help it last longer."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","The Makeup Fiend","OKC",5,"Although the color I bought at this purchase didn't end up looking good on me, I love this brand. I just need to stick with reds!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","My4LoveBeans","Lake Forest, Ca",5,"I bought this lipstick for my daughter and it looks beautiful on her. It is the perfect soft pink color. I am really picky about the colors she wears because she is 16. It complements her and looks like a natural soft pink color. It is long lasting and she has no complaints about it."

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","WalkAwayRenee","Long Beach,CA",5,"I've been through so many red lipsticks. Many of them, for whatever reason, turn either too pink or too brown on my lips. So when I want a true red lip, I've resolved to mixing corals/oranges with the reds I have that don't work straight from the tube. Then...I found this color! It's a perfect slightly warm, vintage red that doesn't turn pink on me. The formula is great too; glides on easily, blends well, and has pretty good staying power. Out of all the MAC,Kat Von D, and Lime Crime I've been trying...the one that works best for me is Revlon. Love it when that happens!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Biz","Chicago, IL",4,"This lipstick has a matte finish which looks really classy. I have fuller lips but this color doesn't make me look like a clown. Great buy!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Sue","Tustin",3,"Pretty color, but this was way too drying for my lips."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Jane","Plymouth",5,"I was first wary of the color because I always pictured &quot;mauve&quot; as having purple, lilac or violet tones. This is actually kind of a neutral taupe - a pink-peach brown with warm undertones. It looks darker in the tube than on your skin or swatched. Considering this is a light and nude shade, you actually get good pigmentation, plus this applies smooth and not too drying. Love this shade, a perfect lips-but-better for me. Here's my in-depth review if anyone is interested: http://www.jellobeans.com/2014/07/revlon-matte-lipstick-in-mauve-it-over-review.html"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Girlie","El Paso Texas",2,"it feels to sheer on the lips ?? enough to be a matte lip stick.."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","KrzTexan","Houston, Texas",1,"I've tried to keep giving the Revlon lipsticks chances. The last three I've purchased have broken on me ! It's always at the base '&amp; it's annoying. I try to make them work because I feel if I try to return it , they won't. So I don't even bother and don't bother to even try. :("
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","peace1089","Florida",1,"There is nothing good about this product. Maybe other colours are better, but I bought Pink Sky, and it is simply awful. I'm throwing it away. It can't even cover the colour of my light pink lips! You can't layer it either because it doesn't go in the crevasses of your lips, so it practically looks like vertical stripes down your lips. I tried blanking out my lips with concealer first (this works with all my other lipsticks to make them look brighter) but it just rubbed it off! Boy, was I mad. This is the WORST lipstick that I have ever bought, period."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","anniieesays","Brooklyn, NY",5,"Matte formulas are usually drying so I put a balm first and rub a coat or two of the pink pout on.  I reapply about two-three times throughout a 12 hour span.  The color stains your lips a bit so reapplication isn't always necessary.  Even when I do reapply I use my fingers to just add a bit more color back on and it also helps since the formula is somewhat drying.  By using my fingers I find that my lips wont flake."

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Jacquelyn","San Jose, CA",4,"The pictures ULTA has online does NOT match the color in person. I recommend that you go into the store itself to check out the color selection.<br /><br />Anyways, I bought this in Mauve it Over. I had a golden skin tone with a sort of brown undertone and it looks very nude on me, which I like! My lips have a mauve color with violet undertones and it gets rid of the sickly violet undertones. I have to reapply the lipstick every two hours, but it's not that bad. If you have dry lips, I don't really recommend this product to you because it will really show off every little flake and crack! And don't apply chapstick as a &quot;base&quot; because it'll turn the lipstick into a dewy one. Just wash your lips with warm water and exfoliate with a towel, and you should be fine!"

It does dry my lips out a little, but if you apply chapstick before it doesn't dry them out! It says matte but it's fairly shiny. The color is great, I've actually only bought nude attitude. The best nude lip I've ever tried. I will come back to this always :)"

Other nude lipsticks were way too peachy and weird, but this is a great colour; just what I hoped for. My only complaint is that it wears off a bit easily (especially compared to other Revlon lipsticks) but other than than, it is pretty good!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Pdas","Seattle, wa",4,"I love it in the colors - Cocoa Craving, Mauve it Over. I would recommend using a lip balm under or over this, since these can feel a little drying.Overall, I love the colors, and would be repurchasing."

The color from outside of the packaging looked really pretty.<br />However as I applied it, I could see this product does not go with its name. It is a very mild pink and looks very cheap. <br />I could not find anything good about this particular lipstick."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","PNWPretty","Seattle, WA",4,"I bought this lipstick in the color really red. It looks amazing for the first couple of hours, but unless you wear lip liner, it can start to lose the defined line around the border of your lips and leak and look smudgy. As with most lipsticks, avoid eating anything oily, because it'll wipe right off. Also, once it's been on for a few hours without reapplication, the matte texture begins to look almost chalky, which is kind of an unpleasant effect. But the color is classic and it applies really well!"

The color and low price are the only things this lipstick has going for it. The color looked different on my lips and the application was clumpy and uneven. I'll probably continue using it, but that's because I'm cheap. I'll look for something else when it runs out."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Magpie","Pasadena, CA",4,"Okay, so I did a lot of research/review reading before I purchased this lipstick in the shade Nude Attitude, knowing the good and the bad about it. For the good price though, I decided to go for it. It cannot/should not be used as a normal lipstick because it WILL make you look like you just rose from dead (the color payoff is very strong). However, you can still use it to achieve a subtle nude lip. I usually put lip balm on first and rub it into my lips very well. Then I take the lipstick and DAB it on very lightly so there's only a hint of nude. Afterwards I'll usually top it off with a gloss and rub that in, then get rid of the excess stuff. Yes, it's a lot of work, but the look is pretty much worth it. It's the only nude lipstick I've purchased so far so I'm planning on making it work! :D So buyer, beware of the effort for this shade/lipstick.. ya gotta know what you're doing with this one."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","elmah5","Houston, TX",5,"I like this lipstick because it is long wearing and when it wears off I still have a sheer wash of color on my lips!  Very nice, not to bright red!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Tori the Minimalist","Washington D.C",3,"Love the color which is long lasting but it accentuates my lip lines even though it is not drying. I'd never use them without a gloss which helps offset the chalkiness. Kind of defeats the purpose I originally bought them for. I tried using a primer but my lips peel a lot so it didn't really help."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Peridot","Los Angeles, CA",4,"I bought the Really Red. I am Asian with warm undertones and the shade of red is perfect! Just make sure you exfoliate before putting on this matte lipstick. Great product!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Andi","DSM, IA",3,"It's pretty drying but I apply a chapstick first before I do any of my makeup. The lips are the last thing I do so when it comes time to use this lipstick, my lips are moisturized enough that this goes on smoother, more even, and looks more natural. I top it off w/ the Peachy Keen (I think??) lipgloss by Revelon as well. Great combo for trendy nude lips."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","MSE","Maryland",2,"I liked the color, but not the texture. This goes on well over top other colors, but the texture of it alone is too drying. I like matte lipsticks, but this one is just way too dry to the point where the color sits in every crack on your lip and dissipates before you know it. Does not go on smoothly by itself."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Kacie209","ND",4,"I have been looking for that perfect pink lip color for-ev-er... and came across this one (Pink Pount) after looking at reviews for brands like MAC, etc. I like it... it's a pink, but not a bright pink. I apply a couple layers and then put a nice pink gloss over it - fabulous! I now carry one in my purse, along with the one in my make up."

For a drugstore brand, they have really nice color payoff and are very rich and true to color. Like all matte lipsticks though, they are not the most moisturizing but if your lips are in good condition then you should be fine. If your lips are already dry I would not recommend these, at least not without applying some sort of lip balm underneath.  Revlon has done it again! Great Product!"

When I applied it on to my lips, the application was a bit cakey and uneven, but I fixed that with applying a layer of chapstick before using this<br /><br />Also, the color looks washed out by its' self on my lips, but once I applied clear gloss on top, the finish was great! love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","llamamama","MN",4,"I have this in both Really Red and Nude Attitude...both are such great colors and look fantastic. Matte lipstick requires absolutely soft/smooth lips so make sure to get a lip exfoliating balm if you have winter lips. It does need re-application I would suggest putting on one layer setting w/powder and apply another layer to get lasting results."

The only problem was that it was very thin, so a few layers were needed in order to get the full nude effect. Also, IDK if it's just my lips, but they got all chapped from application. After the first few times, I just use it as a base, and spread another lipstick shade over it."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Alex","San Marcos, TX",4,"great colors for practically all skin types. All my friends and I look great in all the colors, which is rare because my skin is olive, closer to the yellow side than the green side. It is clumpy, but as long as you throw some chap stick on bottom or a touch of lip gloss on top you should be fine. I would buy this again, and that's a complement from me since I don't like Revlon products."

I don't mind that it's a matte and I understand that matte lipsticks can be drying, but this makes you look like a corpse with chapped lips even when they're not!

Well I found this one and tried it out as soon as I got in the car and have been in love with it since. I was surprised at how easily it went on and how bright the color showed up with one application.  I have never worn lipstick of any kind before but now I can't wait to build a collection of different shades!  The only downside of the Revlon brand is that it comes off really easily, it will show up on anything that touches my lips so I have to reapply often.  Also Revlon doesn't have a big selection of matte shades."

Ive always been unsure of the nude trend with my mostly fair skintone. I feel like the nude color is too close to my skin tone so it makes me look sick or something with my lips being the same shade as the rest of my face. It is a pretty subtle but I think I need a little more pink or some pigment in the lip color. If someone had a different skintone it might look better.<br />This post was sponsored by Revlon as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review."

I had to look all over for this shade, and I can see why it's so popular.  The color is very similar to my lips, so it evens out my lips color and gives me the perfect nude lip.  If you're not a fan of nude lipsticks that are too light (like the color of your skin which wash you out or make your lips disappear), then this is the lipstick for you.  Because this has a matte consistency, be sure your lips are smooth and maybe even wear a moisturizing lip balm underneath the lipstick.  The matte finish makes this look very natural."

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","SMASHMOUTH","San Diego, CA",4,"Nude Attitude (Matte) is decent, especially when taking into consideration the price.  A true nude color, though not as spectacular as Smashbox's Be Legendary Lipstick in the incredibly opaque shade of Nylon Nude.  When first applied to my lips, Nude Attitude looks harsh, much like concealer; however, I find that the color warms up and becomes more natural looking a couple minutes after application.  The color saturation is quite good, quite opaque, and the lipstick has a surprisingly smooth and creamy texture for a matte shade.  For me, Nude Attitude's biggest downfall is that it just doesn't last that long after application."

Do not use this with chapped lips. Some lip gloss over it definitely helps. I got it in Nude Attitude and am very pleased with the color."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Krissy","Maine",2,"i dont like the look or the feel of this matt lipstick. its flat lookign and feels dry and cakey like. i much much prefer the other revlon lipstick. the golden container."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Carla","Chicago, IL",4,"I saw &quot;Mauve it over&quot; on a friend and want to try, because I love Revlon lipsticks. I liked the texture, but I think this color looks better on a skin tone that is not as pale as mine."

"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Avery","Texas",2,"This product comes in a great array of colors and the price is great too. I purchased Wine not, the color is nice for apply just a hint of color. Unfortunately, I found the product was not smooth or creamy enough to apply the lipstick for a dramatic look. I know that chapped lips play a  big part in lipstick and my lips were hydrated and exfoliated, the lipstick just lacked a more creamy texture at least in my opinion. Other than that the lipstick is great for everyday daytime makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Taccora","Virginia",5,"Really red is an amazingly bright true red matte lipstick so remember to exfoliate and moisturizer before applying to prevent drying.  I like to deepen the color a bit with a dark red lip liner and then top it off with NYX's monte color matte cream lipstick."
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","Shellzzzz","Jackson, TN",4,"The color is great! It's a great shade, however, I only have one con. It is a matte color, and it lives up to it's name a little too much. Sometimes it can be very dry. However, I overlook that, and I love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/matte-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod1020032","JLC","Seattle, WA",5,"I really like these matte lipstick line. I recommend exfoliate your lip before use, and use lip balm before applied if you want a good matte finish."
