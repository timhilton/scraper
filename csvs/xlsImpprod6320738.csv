"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","shwetadtt8","Dallas,tx",3,"This is a good eye shadow but I am not sure if its a highlighter. The colors didn't highlight at all.. all looked like shades of brown and the white shade is no shimmer just matte white.. I don't think its for me. I am going to return it."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Char","Vancouver, WA",5,"I use this as eye shadow with another darker eyeshadow. Love this product and keep thinking they might change the color palette or discontinue so I buy several every time in store!!!!"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","KK the runner","Pearland, Texas",1,"I grabbed this highlighter because it was cheap, AND because it had a beautiful looking color pallete. The color was virtually non existent. Waste of what little money I spent on it."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","TEB18","Aurora, IL",5,"Easy to apply - looks like natural light tanning without being over tanned - fake."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Thea","Maryland",4,"This is my most used makeup product ever. Admittedly it could blend a little better but for the price it's pretty good. Personally I like that it glitters a little because it makes your skin look glowing and dewy as long as you use it lightly."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Makeup Maven","Michigan",5,"I bought it in rose gold and it is gorgeous! Absolutely love this! Also, you can use it as a blush as well!"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","ceebee1990","burlington, vt",1,"This is the weirdest product. I've heard people rave about it... And I don't understand. I got the &quot;rose&quot; shade. It has awful pigmentation. It is straight up glittery. Terrible. The glitter is too fine to work as a dramatic party look, and not nearly fine enough to work as an everyday highlighter. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this thing. And it's pretty expensive for a drugstore product."

"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","LD","Clarksville, TN",5,"I love it &amp; use it daily."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Erin","State College Pa",4,"Use it as a highlight/blush. It's very lightweight. Just wish it stayed on longer."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Norma","Chicago IL",4,"Worth the price over higher end highlighters does the job very well!"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Meg","Michigan",5,"I love this stuff! I've been using it for over a month. I have fairly oily and sensitive skin but this stuff has been great. It gives a gorgeous natural glow and really is one of my top 3 summer staples!"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Dmg","Austin, tX",2,"No pigmentation and too much glitter. Gave it 2 stars bc I started wearing it as a highlighter and it's ok."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Crafty Girl","Santa Clarita",5,"I Love this blush. I have been using it for quite some time."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","PC","Michigan",3,"I wanted to try a powder highlight and this seemed like a good jumping off point. Meh. The soft pink undertone is nice but there's just too much glitter in this. I wanted something with more of a sheen or glow."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Faith dancer","middleboro MA",2,"I was really disappointed with this product, there was no pigmentation, it hardly showed up and what did show up was just sparkle, which looked totally fake. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."

"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","PJ","Tennessee",5,"Priced well and quality product"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Brittanyyrb","San Antonio",3,"I really like the color of this Revlon blush, but if you use just a little too much it can make your face look very shiny and glittery.  <br />Having naturally oily skin, I stay clear of anything that gives me more shine, and I'm not really into any kind of make up that looks like it has glitter in it. I will probably pick up a new blush to replace this one as soon as I head back to Ulta."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Crafty Girl","Santa Clarita",5,"I use this product everyday."

"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Kate","Fort Worth",5,"I use this for highlighting and contouring cheeks with a fan brush.  Works great, great colors, stays all day."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Teebee","Greenville NC",5,"Goes with everything!"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","allee","greenville, nc",5,"This is perfect,  the color, the shimmer, everything is perfect!  Only bronzer I use now, better than hoola bronzer by benefit."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","jazzy","Portland, OR",5,"I use this after I put on my foundation.  It adds color to my face without making it look caked on."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","beachlover","Orlando, FL",3,"Nice color, gives you a bit of a touch of sun on the face"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Realtor","Naperville, IL",4,"Brightens completion!"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Caroline","Wausau, WI",4,"I fell in love with this product the first time I tried it. I have it in peach glow and rose glow and love both! I like to mix the colors together and use it as a blush. The only issue I find is that there can be some fall out of the product. Using a lighter hand when applying also helps give a more natural look."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Orangefelt","Atlanta, GA",4,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I used this product. The colors are very pigmented. Don't be too heavy handed with the bronzer brush or else it'll put too much on. I have used it as bronzer, as a brow bone highlighter, and as eyeshadows too. I think it's a great product! I didn't even wear primer and it lasted 6-7 hours on my face! For the price, I think you are getting a great deal- a product that you can use 3 ways. I used to use Smashbox fusion lights, but I actually prefer this product because it is less shimmery and lasts a lot longer."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Purplejewel","Fredericksburg, VA.",4,"I bought this product because of the lovely combination of pink colors.  I actually use it as a blush instead of a highlighter and it works well for me I this regard.  I will admit that it is not very pigmented but it works for me because my skin is very pale.  It takes a few swipes to get the amount of color on my check bones that I am looking for but once it is on, it looks lovely with a slight shimmer to it.  I find this color looks very good as a blush in combination with a rainbow highlighter that I recently purchased.  It is a perfect color for summer when you don't want to look quite as &quot;done up&quot;.  I think it looks very natural and I plan to use it consistently throughout the summer."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Ama","Seattle",2,"I like it , but i have 2 put a lot!! In order 2 look like a normal blush :("
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","BoyMomma","Bakersfield, CA",5,"I wanted something with pink and orange tones and this was perfect! Not too glittery, just a nice glow for summer."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Liz C.",44136,3,"I use some of the colors to highlight areas, almost like contouring. I feel that you need to be very fair skinned for the pigmentation to show. Also, if you have redness in your face, it will bring the redness out. As a result, I can only use a few of the color palates and not the entire product. Generally I dap my finger, or the edge of a soft brush to apply. The lightest color is great for highlighting the inside corner of your eyes for a dramatic effect."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Plum Moon","Ohio",5,"Just the Right Amount of Shimmer! But I think the Brush Application is Important. I use a Goat brush or other brush that is more rough texture to make sure shimmer gets picked up and deposited onto skin.  I see reviews saying shimmer didn't show up...not sure if this is do to the brush used.  All the &quot;IT Cosmetics&quot; like make-up brushes might be too smooth for this....too fluffy.  Otherwise the application will probably fall flat and translucent like.  I found this wears all day and love to see the shimmer over my blush."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Leanne","Jefferson City, Mo",4,"The only problem I had with this highlighter was that it just wouldn't pick up on my brush! To fix the problem I just simply used my pointer finger to apply the highlighter and it worked just fine. Pigmentation and shine were spot on for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Andi","Fort Woth, Texas",1,"I returned this because it had absolutely 0 pigmentation. It was like nothing. Just dust. Nothing stuck to the skin."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Abigail S.","Everett, WA",1,"Not sure if I didn't use this product properly or what but it just doesn't show up on my skin and I have fair skin, not much of a shimmer to it so I don't consider it a highlighter. Disappointed..."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","LJ","Utah",4,"I like that it's a mix between blush and bronzer and gives a natural look that I like. I've been using this product for over a year and haven't been able to find another blush/bronzer mix that is as good as this one."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Y","Houston, Tx",3,"It seems to be very light when added to the cheeks"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Shonacat","Parma, Ohio",4,"Starting to experiment with highlighting and contouring, this is a great basic highlighter that's easy to apply and doesn't require a lot of know how, just a big fluffy brush. Made my skin look as if I had a nice touch of color from the sun, even though it's winter. Touch ups are required as it only lasts a few hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Cat Bru","Corona, CA",3,"I use this product everyday. I love it. The only con, it doesn't last all day"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Southern Belle","NC",5,"On my second one.  Love the end result of these colors mixed together.  Not harsh at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","bethas20","Pittsburgh PA",1,"Pigment is terrible"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Chrissy","Vancouver,WA",5,"Is great blends well"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","MCLW","Frederick MD",4,"This product was purchased for my daughter, however I did try it and I felt it went on evenly, added a natural brightening to the skin as well as good color."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Tina","Ct",2,"It is ok not much as a highlighter at least for me it works as a very light Baluch topper"
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","LB","Richmond VA",5,"I've tried so many different drugstore highlighters (nyx, maybelline, physicians formula) and really disliked the chunky glitter in all of them, so I had low expectations when I picked this up on clearance. I bought the shade peach glow and it's actually a beautiful, natural, non-obnoxious highlighter when swirled together. Definitely recommend."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Kim","Apple valley ca",2,"I wouldn't recommend this product. I thought it was eyeshadow."
"http://www.ulta.com/highlighting-palette?productId=xlsImpprod6320738","Freedomrider","New Freedom, Pa",4,"Great for every day and for use in all Seasons."
