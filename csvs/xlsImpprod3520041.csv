Its very light weight and that what I love about it. I use this on top of my foundation and concealer for shine control and it does it job. I'm not sure if i will repurchase this product again maybe if Revlon comes out with more shades."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Taylor","Houston, TX",4,"This powder is amazing! It's a great price and makes my complexion look fantastic. I just wish it stayed on longer without needing to be reapplied (it does NOT last 16 hours like advertised. It's usually gone by the end of my 8 hour shift, so I reapply every 4 hours and it's fine. But I also have oily skin, so maybe ladies with normal skin will have a longer lasting finish!)"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Jenn","West Chester, PA",3,"I had this powder this past summer and I enjoyed it but then I ran out. I have been using another powder lately, but I decided to try this one again. I was very excited to get it, remembering my past experience with it during the summer. However, this time it was so drying that it made my skin feel so tight and dry and awful looking even with a light moisturizer underneath!! This powder is great for the hot summer months, but it does  not work well in the winter months ... at least not for my skin type anyway and I have pretty oily skin. I chose &quot;no I would not recommend this to a friend&quot; at the bottom simply because I have found powders that work well both during the summer and winter months and this one does not."

I thought I would try something cheaper.  I am extremely pleased with the coverage and how long it lasts throughout the day as well as how long it lasts in general."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Peetie","Dallas, TX",4,"I have been a loyal buyer with a different long-time retailer for years- they have a fantastic powder foundation but I also have been looking for a long time for something comparable but less expensive. I finally found it in this! No need for any liquid foundation first-this does two jobs at once. And, at less than half the price of what I had been paying.<br />I do have to apply more often- few times in the a.m. and again in the p.m. and I use different (actually better) sponges to apply this. That would be the only negative- the round soft pad to apply is very flimsy and does not make it go on as well- use a better sponge for better results.<br />I would definitely recommend this."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Beauty pro","Woodhaven mi",2,"It looks like a different color once it's applied"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","livinggeekchic","Aurora, IL",4,"This is pretty nice powder. I think I like their PhotoReady one a little better though. The color on this one is just a little too dark and seems to go on heavier. But, it's still good--I certainly won't return it, I'll use it up."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Miss Autumn","Indiana USA",5,"I use this powder to set my foundation and concealer...doesnt crease if powder is applied generously"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","On the Go","USA",4,"good product for acne-prone, sensitive skin because it is oil-free and talc free.  I use the translucent color to set foundation or tinted moisturizer.  I use the medium if I'm only wearing powder.  I have fair skin and the Light was too light.  Maybe it will work in the winter when I'm not tan, but you may want to go a shade darker than you would usually buy."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","s11","or",3,"I bought this as I'm a fan of Revolon's Colorstay Foundation. I thought this would be a good powder but it's didn't impress me.<br />I did like that it's not yellow or ashy like many powders on the market. When I put the powder on, you couldn't even tell I was wearing it. <br />That being said, it didn't control my oiliness nor did I feel like it helped set my makeup in for longer. <br />Not a bad product but I'm still searching for something that will actually help control my shine and set my makeup."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Meggles","Grand Rapids, MI",4,"I use it as a foundation. I do not think it lasts 16 hours, but the texture is soft and lightweight and it lasts longer than any other I have tried."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","AmirsMama","Glenolden, Pa",4,"The only pro is its a little too light, but some bronzer fixes that. this formula is pretty good."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Luna","rancho cucamonga, ca",5,"Do not use this powder if what you want is coverage you'll only end up looking caked and unnatural. However, it is perfect as a finishing powder. Just dust lightly over your foundation and it&quot;ll make your makeup LAST FOREVER. No matter what foundation or tinted moisturizer I used underneath it it stays put."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Susie","Memphis, Tn",3,"I like the coverage and feel of this product, but the color is very inconsistent. For example, I have two of these pressed powders in the same shade of &quot;Pale&quot;, but just by looking at them there is a noticeable difference in shades, almost as if they were mislabeled."

I tried this one because the same brand in liquid foundation is great.  The powder version does not cover as well.  Would be good as a back up touch up powder in your purse."

I personally use it as a setting powder in conjunction with my Revlon foundation, and it works really well. I would not use it alone however, because much like any powder, it's not a miracle product. Makeup is best done in stages/layers, and there isn't any one product by itself that will make a tremendous difference--it's a combination of multiple items, in my opinion. It's a very lightweight powder, and for my skin tone (extremely pale), it matches well.<br /><br />Overall---a good buy!"

It doesn't blend and just looks like powder sitting on my skin. It accentuates any flake of dry skin on my face and makes my skin look dried out and aged even though I have somewhat oily skin, not a good look at all."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","ma","Oro Valley, AZ",4,"I tan easily and want one product that will &quot;adapt&quot; to a degree to changing amount of color of tan as season progresses.  Do not like heavy coverage.   Use brush instead of applicator that came with this product because I could control amount (more in spots near hairline for example) and less on rest of face.  Also was able to brush lightly around eyes which are most sensitive area with no adverse effect.  <br />Could not find a problem with it and I have sensitive, dry skin and do not like obvious heavy makeup.   This product took care of every problem."

I loved the price and was excited to use it. The shades of the product are a little complicating. For me I was between light and fair. I ended up buying both just to see which was better. After using this product I love the fact that it covers my Slight acne (not much, not big). It also covers the red hue my cheeks tend to have. One thing I love is that my face stays shine free all day. Trust me I HATE a shiny face. So overall I really like this product and think its a good buy for the price."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","JewelyBee","Corpus Christi, TX",4,"I have never used pressed powder before. I noticed that with my routing of using only foundation...my face just looked flat and gross by the end of the day. I usually splurge on Urban Decay and other pricey cosmetics but was in a pinch to try some powder. I really like this stuff minus the fact that there aren't really that many shades to work with. My skin is bronze and anything I use on it has to have hints of yellow. This stuff LOOKS amazing in indoor lighting but outside it makes my face about a shade lighter than my neck. That could be my own fault for not opting for another powder closer to my skin but that aside, the finish is fantastic for the price."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Karen","Fort Myers, FL",5,"I use this with a blurring brush to keep it light and it works great. The pad that comes with it can make it a bit thick."

After searching numerous forums, Revlon ColorStay Pressed Powder was the most suggested/reviewed product as an equivalent replacement. While the powder went on beautifully, my face began breaking out within 3 hours of application. (This was the only new thing introduced, be it makeup, food, soap, etc.) I attributed it to hormonal acne and tried it again a few days later--same results. Two weeks after the initial application and I'm left with horrible Cystic Folliculitis all over my face. My forehead is riddled, my cheeks to my &quot;sideburns&quot; are awful, and my nose to my chin is so splotchy! It's horrible!!! Revlon is also one of the major &quot;drugstore&quot; makeup brands (along with L'Oreal) that has so many reactions to their products. Just please be careful what you put on your face!"

It's doesn't look cakey and covers minor imperfections well.  It doesn't settle into creases and best of all it lasts a long time.  I usually can go all day at work without a touch up - other products I would look like I had nothing on by lunch. This is my go to daily finishing powder."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Brit","Maryland",5,"I bought this because I use the Colorstay for oily/normal skin and needed something to control the shine in the humidity/hot weather.  I love it.  It goes on really well without smudging my foundation around and matches the Ivory #110 foundation perfectly.  I sometimes have a problem with foundations/powders that look too orange on my fair skin but these products work for me, even better than the various expensive foundations I've tried."

I usually use it to set my foundation but will also use it alone to not feel so naked on a lazy day. I didn't care for the applicator. It kind of has rough edges so if you're applying near the under eye area, beware."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Kayla","Loretto, PA",2,"I absolutely love Revlon ColorStay liquid foundation, so I decided to give this product a try. First thing I noticed was the smell... I understand that sometimes make-up has acne medication smells, but this one did not have it in it, nor did it smell like that certain &quot;acne product&quot; smell. I can't pinpoint it exactly, but it does not smell good at all. Next, when I put it on, I could see the powder laying on my face. It was not good coverage at all and after about a week of using it, my skin broke out. I would not recommend this product at all if you have oily skin, sensitive skin, and want any coverage at all. The liquid foundation though? It's awesome."

It dosent cover much at all. It will control the shine but only for a short while and when i reapply it it looks cakey. I still use it everyday just because i don't want it to go to waste but i have to use other powders on top to make it work."

I would have picked a shade darker. Overall, not impressed, and won't be repurchasing because it's just nothing special."

It went on well and provided just enough coverage so that I did not look too bare.  It was a bit messy, but that may be due to the size of the brush I used.  I tried to be more careful when I realized I had powder spilling over to the side of the compact.  If you are fair like me and simply want to take away the unmade look of your face for a quick trip out in public, this powder should work.  Next time I will try it over liquid foundation and see how it works.  Enjoy!"

I wouldn't recommend this product because I think there are better pressed powders out there for the same amount, but it might do ok on an oily skin."

It not great for everyday wear but since it goes on kind of thick, it covers well. If you spend all day at the office and have an engagement right after, it is perfect to give you that &quot;freshened up&quot; look."

It did take away the shine and left my skin looking soft and silky. I really liked it to where I think I'll continue to buy it instead of my usual department store powder."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Ash","River Forest, IL",4,"I got this because Revlon products were buy 2, get 2 free. I really needed a setting powder-I use it to control the shine with my super oily skin. They didn't have any (I'm still not sure if Revlon even sells setting powder) so I thought I'd try out a power foundation to go over my liquid foundation to help with that. It works surprisingly well. The coverage is pretty good for a powder foundation too. If you're someone that likes a light-medium coverage you would probably like this product alone too."

Quite frankly, after having to cut down my expenses 3 years ago, I tried this product out (courtesy of my wonderful beautiful awesome mother). I must say, I was rather impressed. I have stuck to this product since and don't plan on switching anytime soon. Can't beat the price either quite frankly!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Silver Sterling","Oklahoma City, OK",5,"Nice powder. Leaves a nice matte finish, but not &quot;flat&quot;. Lasts all day as long as there's no sweat."

I have oily skin especially around my nose area and I have to say this powder is the best drugstore powder I have used."

I really like this product and think it lasts pretty well for a budget brand product. It usually lasts 7 hrs before I feel like it's wearing off or before I can see shine peeking through."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-pressed-powder?productId=xlsImpprod3520041","Kate","Lehigh valley pa",5,"Colorstay liquid foundation and pressed powder are my current go-to. I used to use the big fluffy RT brush to apply powders but it often made the powder to obvious so I use the little foams round application pads and press the powder onto my foundation and vwalaa! Flawless finish."
