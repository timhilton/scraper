I don't know if it's a special they were having but these tweezers were very dul. Gorgeous design but didn't serve its purpose now I have to go buy more."

"http://www.ulta.com/love-collection-by-leah-goren-slant-tweezer?productId=xlsImpprod6400550","Desperately seeking tweezers","Dallas, TX",1,"I've purchased other Revlon brand tweezers - those that used to come with a warranty to sharpen tweezers for free. They've been such great quality, I haven't had to send the tweezers back for sharpening. When the need finally arose (5 years later) I lost the warranty info, so I opted to purchase another pair. This has become a MAJOR ordeal in my house. My husband is so sick of hearing me talk about new tweezers that he's convinced that I'm just not using the old pair correctly...me - the girl who learned to use tweezers in junior high - has somehow forgotten the proper way in which to hold tweezers. HAH! <br />Anyway, I finally purchased what I thought were similar tweezers to what I had before. I used them once. ONE TIME. I went to use them a second time and they were not working. As in, they were not gripping the hair. After examination, I noticed that one of the pointy edges is now blunt. All I can think is that they somehow fell out of the cupboard and that caused a blunt edge. Normally, I would think that's user error, what can you expect? However, after using the same tweezers for 5+ years - through many travels, drops, tosses - those same tweezers hardly showed wear and tear. I am not impressed with this new pair. In fact, I'm rather upset. The search for a new, better, reasonably priced pair continues."
