You do not need to apply layers. 1 to 2 swipes to each lash works perfectly. I use neutrogena make up wipes and they take all the water proof mascara off. It take a few wipes but it's worth it."

BUT after a few hours it smudges under my bottom lashes. Even if I don't put any on my lower lashes! It flakes and I end up with specks of mascara on my face."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Ellie","Chicago",1,"Very disappointed.  Says it lengthens, but it does not.  It is NOT waterproof as advertised.  It leaves a black circle around your eye.  Brush is too fat.  Clumps some."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Themimb","Mount Pleasant, SC",1,"Save your money. Although this mascara claims to be waterproof, it most definitely is not. I tried this for the first time today and within a few hours of wearing it at school (I am a kindergarten assistant), I had large black smudges underneath my eyes. This will be going in the trash. Disappointing. I am glad I got it on a buy one get one offer otherwise I would have been even more ticked. In the meantime, my quest for the perfect mascara continues..."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","songraven32","Texas",1,"Really wish I had read the reviews on this one first.  This is not waterproof in any way.  Within an hour or two, it was flaking off all over my face.  I have never used a mascara that was this bad.  Went in the trash less than a week from purchase."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Stacy","Augusta, GA",1,"Don't waste your time or money. Flakes all over the face and doesn't lengthen. Actually, it doesn't do anything. What little bit of product that gets on my lashes flakes off."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Mare Bear","Peoria, AZ",1,"I will be taking this product back to the store. I'm not sorry that I tried it, but it did not work for me."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Mary Ann Revilla","Fort Worth",5,"It doesn't need that much to make your lashes long.  Definitely will purchase"
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Mary","Anderson SC",5,"No clumping.  Easy to apply."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Makeup Wearer","Los Angeles, CA",1,"I've used mascara that was not waterproof that didn't smudge as much as this. I had raccoon eyes by the end of the day. This mascara is horrible."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Busy Bee","Fort Smith",1,"I got this mascara for lengthening because I have really short lashes. This product just didn't work for me. The brush wasn't great and the formula itself wasn't impressive. I hope it works for others."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Vlo","Traverse city",2,"Would not purchase again."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Becca Boop","Portland, OR",1,"I had raccoon eyes by day's end the first time I used it.  Even though it was waterproof,  I thought maybe I had too much moisturizer,  so I gave it another try. Same thing."
"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","tander1020","Lakeland FL",1,"I've bought $1 mascara that had worked better. <br />Put on, within 2 hours it literally melted down. I had raccoon rings under my eyes.  Tried again thinking it might have been a moisturizer that caused it. Same issue. My daughter tried it the day after I complained and she came back within a couple hours with the same issue.  No staying power. Minimal lash lengthening properties, clumps instantly. <br /><br />Makes me wonder what they were thinking when they made this mascara.  It's supposed to be water proof, it might be, but it certainly isn't minimal wear proof. Don't waste your money."

"http://www.ulta.com/super-length-waterproof-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod13541023","Kat","Columbia",1,"I had used Grow  luscious plumping  mascara since Revlon came out with it, It gave length and volume. After reading info about the new mascara, I picked the one that Relvon stated was close to the Grow Luscious formula. It was not at all like the old mascara. It was so thin and sticky and clumbed my lashes together! I loved the fact that the old mascara had a formula that was good for your lashes and would help them grow. As far as I can tell the new mascaras do not. Why do companies discontinue products when they sell, unless this mascara had stop selling, I wish they would bring it back!!"
