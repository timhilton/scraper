"http://www.ulta.com/ultimate-slant-tip-tweezer?productId=xlsImpprod3420115","HeidiHeartsSkincare","Louisiana",5,"These tweezers are a much higher quality than I was expecting. They are sturdy and the slate tip makes it easy to groom my eyebrows. They are precise and grip very well. They make grooming my eyebrows a breeze. For the price compared to the name brand tweezers I was considering buying, you can't beat them."
