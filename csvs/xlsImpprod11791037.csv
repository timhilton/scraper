And looks horrible in photos and it says PHOTO Ready. I will say this is buildable coverage and it's very liquidy and thin so if not put on properly it will look streaky. This foundation would be so much better if they changed it!"

I first discovered it at another place first, I really don't understand these other reviews! The product is great, really smooths out the look of imperfections and large pours!

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-airbrush-effect-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791037","Jessie","Auburn Hills, MI",4,"I'm cheap when it comes to makeup in general, I also know that buying cheap doesn't always give you the look you want. Especially since I have trouble skin and large pores. For a brand that isn't upwards of 20 to 40 dears a bottle, this liquid foundation does a pretty great job. I use a sponge to apply it, and when I'm lazy, my fingers. It has little &quot;sparkles&quot; or light reflecting particles that make my skin look flawless (as flawless as my skin can look) and it feels lightweight and not heavy at all."

This foundation isn't bad by any means it's just not what I like. I like lightweight and this is very heavy. However, usually the lightweight stuff comes off and this definitely stays. It does help a lot to even pores and I like that, but it's also caused me to break out a lot which I hate. I would suggest a good moisturizer and primer before applying this, I think those would help. I currently use Rodan+Fields oil free lotion and this stuff works well together, doesn't get oily through the day, but I think a primer would help the foundation go on a little easier."
"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-airbrush-effect-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791037","Rosie","Las Vegas, NV",1,"I was disappointed in with this foundation. I normally use the maybelline fit me foundation. I wanted to try a  different foundation so I thought why not this one its pretty good priced. I do not like it at all it gives off kind of a sparkly finish to it i don't know it was weird. The finish look of it was ok it did have good coverage but it was just really sparkly for me. When I applyed a powder over it the sparklyness kind of went away but as the day went on the whole foundation just wore off."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-airbrush-effect-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791037","Rachel","New York, NY",1,"Revlon Photoready Airbrush Effect Review <br /><br />This is the new and improved formula of the original Photoready makeup. Except that it's not any better than the original, it's much worse. The only makeup I ever used was the original Photoready and I loved it immensely. I had my winter and summer shades all picked out, the formula was not too drying or greasy (and I have extremely oily skin) and the subtle hints of shimmer that could only be seen in the sun was such a unique element to this makeup. I loved it. I bought Photoready over and over again and I was thrilled to have finally found a drugstore makeup that worked for me. I recently ran out of my winter shade (004 nude) and went to buy another bottle but noticed all that was available was Airbrush effect. I decided to try it anyways. As soon as I put it on my skin at home, it turned into a horrible orange color. I didn't know what was going on, I shook the bottle and attempted to use it again but the same thing happened! I double checked the shade on the bottle but it was clearly the same one I always picked up. The &quot;new&quot; formula has changed the color. Once I checked the ingredients, I noticed the sunscreen has switched from titanium dioxide+zinc oxide to octinoxate. I am never buying this product again b/c of the ingredients switch(the previous sunscreens were great for my sensitive skin) and the fact that the color got messed up b/c of this new formula. I hope the original comes back. I am so disappointed in Revlon-You took a great product and made it 90x worse."

The last bottle I bought said &quot;New and improved&quot; and something about super sunscreen on the bottle. I used it twice and had a MAJOR rosacea breakout in just four hours. OK, I thought, &quot;this couldn't be the makeup I've worn for years, could it?&quot; Well, I gave my skin time to calm down and tried it not once but twice more and EVERY time it was the same thing. I returned it to the store. I don't know what you did Revlon, but whatever it was, you just lost a long-time customer on this foundation."

I went to ultra and this product looked EXACTLY like the other one minus like one word. I didn't know till I got home that it wasn't the one I always buy. So I try to find my color, however it looked a lot darker than normal&hellip; I am ivory so I got ivory.. but I got it anyway thinking the colors should still be true. NO. If you are pale like me, this color is not ivory.. it is noticeably darker than their other products ivory so now i'm stuck looking darker because I can't keep buying $14 foundations. It's not a huge deal, I know it's just foundation, but if you got it mistaken for the other product, you're not the only one. Don't get me wrong, I love the foundation, even though it is slightly oily, but the colors can change so beware and watch your packaging."

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-airbrush-effect-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791037","amateur artist","colorado springs, co",4,"If I use this on dry skin I use heavy moisturizers. It is quite thick, but I find that when I mix it moisturizer it does not sheer out the coverage too much. It looks great in photos because of the glitter. This creates a very luminous skin finish, and I suggest using it for special occasions where you will be in a lot of pictures (Prom, wedding, fancy dinner, military balls, etc.) The darker shades are great, if only just a bit ashy for many women."

When I first put this on I was in love. Covered my acne scars completely but when I saw my reflection in the sunlight I was seriously shocked. WHY is there glitter in a foundation?? And after just a couple hours the foundation started to separate everywhere and looked very cakey. I honestly couldn't wait to get home and wash it off! Only reason it got two stars is for the coverage"

My all time favorite is the Whipped Foundation in the jar.  Medium Beige is the PERFECT color choice for me, it's a spot-on match for my skin tone.  So imagine my surprise when I bought the PhotoReady Airbrush Effect foundation in the pump bottle, in Medium Beige of course, and it looked ORANGE on my skin!  Horrified.  I even tried to put my Whipped Foundation over it, trying to disguise the 'off' color, and no dice.  It bled right through in all 'it's shoe-polish looking' glory.  It  was a total waste of money.  Unfortunately, I didn't purchase it from Ulta so there is no return on it, either.  (Lesson learned, Ulta.)  Of course I'm disappointed, I really wanted to love this formula, but I won't be trying any other colors.  I'm scared of it now.  It just amazes me how two Revlon formulas with the exact same color name can be many, many shades different.  This was a HUGE miss for me and I can't even give it away.  I don't know a single woman with &quot;that&quot; colored skin."

It doesn't blend well with concealer and leaves streaks once on.  Awful decision!!"

I have searched and searched for different AFFORDABLE makeup, and this one seems to take the cake. I have had acne for years, and this makeup seems to be the best bet for not over-drying your skin and not feeling super oily. I love it. It makes me feel beautiful every time I wear it. I have very fair skin, so for those who have very fair skin, I recommend this makeup because it isn't too red or too dark (I have had this trouble with Rimmel, CoverGirl, Maybelline and even some BM Products)."

It covers great and looks beautiful on the skin within the first 25 minutes of wearing it but after that you look awful. DO NOT BUY!!"

As they did not have the product I usually buy I grabbed this one and I am sorely disappointed. It looked okay for the first 1-2 hours, although you have to apply it with a trowel to get decent coverage. But as the day went on I noticed that instead of smoothing the look of my skin it highlighted every tiny pore and wrinkle, making them much more obvious than without makeup."

I love this foundation, but I dislike that there is glitter in it. I'm sure that's only because it is made for photography and the glitter makes your skin shine. Although it's glittery, it's not to the extent that I look like a disco ball. I really love the coverage it has considering the low price."

I use colorstay for oily skin during summer hot days (love it), colorstay for dry skin during winter (love it) and this one for the rest of the year. Revlon make the best drugstore foundations in my opinion. I could go without the light shimmer, but since my skin is aging I don't mind it. It goes right into the skin but still gives great coverage. I found that lots of other foundations sort of sit on top of skin which I hate. This one (and other Revlon foundations) has really beautiful natural look. I have tried several other drugstore brands that were hard to blend, didn't offer coverage, sank in my pores, had the white dots look (ugh), but this foundation definitely works for me."

U can make it as full coverage as you please.  I only gave it 3 star bs compared to high end products u can tell there's a difference, but it's a good value overall.  I also decreased 1 more star bc I have acne and when my pimples start to dry the makeup begins to peel along those edges.  This ofcourse, is hard to control.  I was shiny mid day but I always powder off the shine and I'm good to go.  You cannot use this with a creamy primer such as pore less or others like it.  It mixes well with my oil of Olay serum."

I picked up the lightest shade (ivory), and this is still too dark for me! And yes its winter, so this foundation will be much more useful in the spring and summer as i get color, but im not snow white with the skin, so that means there is many more shades that would be even lighter than my complexion that this line doesn't have.

It literally is sticky after applying, and has sparkles in it. It is not matte and shows almost every poor and crease in your face. You pretty much have to put pressed powder on to try and deal with the terribleness that is this foundation. Two stars because its heavy, so the coverage is good...but it is sticky to the touch, makes your makeup brushes hard, and is uncomfortable to wear. BOO."

This advertises being photo ready, assuming similar to the Makeup Forever HD Foundation, but I would say far from it. The benefit of this foundation is that it is easy to apply and fairly build-able, however; it does streak throughout the day. <br /><br />I woke in a profession where I have to have a put together on a daily basis and, of course, putting on a face. Well the first couple of days, this was great. It went on easily, worked well, and lasted most of the day. When I was at an event with my husband he asked why I had so much glitter on my face. Oddly enough, looked into the light and my face was covered in little specks of glitter. Honestly, having dark toned skin and then it covered in glitter is not so professional looking. Additionally, it's somewhat greasy and needs to be blotted or a layer of powder over it at least once a day. <br /><br />Overall, a no go for me on this one."

I was super scared to buy this because of the reviews, but I've never tried to original formula so I can't compare. <br /><br />This foundation was totally different than what I expected. When I pumped some out, it looked like clay and it just looked like it wouldn't turn out so good, but when I blended it out, it came out pretty nice. It doesn't give a complete &quot;airbrush&quot; look, but it does a good job with coverage. It doesn't last long, like allll day and late evening, but it lasts as long as I'd like it. I don't regret this purchase."

I thought at first it was just a fluke with the particular bottle I purchased. It wasn't. I purchased 3 more bottles trying to color match. I knew EXACTLY which one matched my skin before they &quot;improved&quot; the formula and now all of them have an orange tint and it doesn't match or blend well. I am incredibly disappointed that Revlon would change what WAS a great product. It's frustrating as a customer to try to find something new, because I certainly won't be using the *new* junk. With the old formula, I would brag about this product and I can't tell you how often people would ask me what makeup I used. I would always send them right to Revlon PhotoReady makeup. Even when I worked for the world's #1 cosmetic brand, I wore Revlon foundation. I would get private messages on Facebook of people asking me what I use.. every time, I'd give them the name of your product. Never again. Please FIX Revlon PhotoReady make-up!"

As others have stated, this stuff sparkles.  I was putting this foundation on in a natural light, and as soon as I got into any sort of artificial light I looked like someone bedazzled my pores. The formula was not as light as I expected, either- it just cakes onto your face. Overall it was okay, until I woke up the next morning to a small brigade of zits. Thanks, but no thanks, Revlon."

It covers my skin well, and I have hyperpigmented spots from old acne. It blends easy enough for me and I LOVE the pump. I have fair skin and I wear the BUFF color. <br />I do NOT LIKE the micro glitter in it. I know, I know...its in there to give that illuminated look, but I get enough of that from my highlighters, blushes and bronzers. <br />I will keep using this make-up, but I do wish they took the micro glitter out."

I decided to try the photo ready airbrush effect and was very disappointed. It is much more sheer than the Colorstay and made my face very greasy after only 4 hours of wear. I am also not a big fan of the glitter in this formula. It made my face very reflective, which I did not like. I definitely recommend the Colorstay formula, especially if you have oily/acne prone skin like I do. it really does last all day, with the exception of needing a touch of powder on my t zone midday. I still love Revlon, just not this product!"

I think they have quality products and are as good as the ones you pay more for in the high-end department stores.  I have been using the PhotoReady foundation and powder for about 2 years.  I LOVED it.  After learning they had changed this product I contacted Revlon. I was told the colors had also changed.  Based on the color I had been wearing the representative advised me on what color would probably be comparable to that (004 Nude).  I purchased the new formula in that color and was immediately disappointed.  The color seemed dark and it did have an orange look.  I tested the shade below this color but it was too light for me.  And yes, it is glittery.  The texture is different from the old product.  The previous foundation felt creamier and it would glide on and blend in so easy. And it did give my face a airbrushed look. This new formula seems to dry fast and it does not blend well at all.  I now look blotchy because no matter how hard I work with it, it does not blend in. I have used it 3 times and get the same effect every time. They really messed up a good product.  Unfortunately, I will be looking for a different foundation."

I was looking for something more matte. However, it does the job I wanted. I am natural beige I believe and I found it too yellowish if that makes sense. I read reviews and saw that you powder your face or brush off the shimmer after it sets. I will try that and hope it works. Overall its a good foundation for the price. If you're looking for something more airbrushed then diorskin airflash would be more suitable."

I always use a bit of powder to set my foundation though so that may help. It's medium to heavy coverage--I have some acne scarring and it really covers those areas nicely. Feels a bit heavy and tight but I can live with that. I have oily/dry combination skin and though I am usually a nude beige I got the lighter plain &quot;nude&quot; color and that worked really well with my skin tone.

So I substituted for the time being with Revlons Photoready Airbrush foundation. I've used revlon foundations many times, but I've never bought the &quot;photo ready.&quot; Typically that means shimmer- which this product has. I was a bit hesitant to use it on a daily basis bc of that, but for lack of having any other foundation at the time, I tried it. It has decent coverage- a bit thinner than I would prefer, but it builds well. The shimmer isn't extremely noticeable, but it does give you a nice &quot;glow.&quot; I have the 003 Shell, and in store it seemed like the right shade, but it seems to become a bit too orangey by the end of the day.

At first impression, the gel-ish texture felt good on my skin, had great pigmentation, and had a pump (which is the reason I'd stopped using my previous foundation). I applied it that night to go out and thought it was perfect. My skin looked airbrushed and felt fantastic all night, and it was easy to apply.<br /><br />However, it didn't stay perfect for long. Cleaning this foundation out of my Beauty Blender was a pain, and I felt like I couldn't use my sponge without immediately doing a full cleaning between uses because of the texture left on it. <br /><br />Soon, the application went bad. A few days after first using it, I applied a full face of make-up and walked out of the house to see my face covered in so much glitter that I could have been mistaken for the cast of Twilight! At the time, I assumed that the glitter wasn't from the foundation and was the result of my carelessness. It drove me so crazy that I removed it with Vaseline in the car. A few days later, when I had my magnification mirror, I saw that the culprit for the glitter was this foundation. Then came the worst day of all. During the recent cold spell, I applied my foundation normally and saw that it was refusing to go into my skin. It was just sitting there and causing this awful texture. I removed it all and opted for a BB cream. <br /><br />I honestly feel like I can't give the foundation a 1 star because the first night was so good with it! Maybe I let it get cold or just need to use it at night. But I have to admit that this is the full coverage foundation that pushed me back to BB creams and just concealer.  Will I use this foundation regularly or even buy it again? No."

This foundation never get orangey, provides great coverage, and lasts all day (sometimes two, haha). It blends so naturally with my skin tone, too, there's no line from face to neck whatsoever. It's been a while since I tried something new, maybe other brands have stepped up their game, but this stuff works. I have to buy it in Ivory, everything else is too dark for me, even Vanilla, but they have a good range of colors for all type.<br /><br />NOTE: Pairing with the Photoready powder to set you makeup can look a little pancake-y according to my mother.

This foundation was hard for me to apply. I felt like I was dragging the foundation on my face. It feels lightweight and stays put all day (for me). This foundation also has sparkles in it and I am not a fan. I got into my car and looked at myself in the mirror and there was a lot of glitter on my face.

"http://www.ulta.com/photoready-airbrush-effect-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod11791037","Magpie","Vancouver, WA",1,"I bought this foundation after making a trip to ULTA and discovering that the foundation I LOVE was discontinued. After pacing the ailes looking at foundation I picked this one. Very dissapointing. I was really bummed to find that it was difficult to find what to apply it with. My beauty blender and all my foundation brushes just seemed to push the product around in weird patches. I found my fingers were the best option which meant it was more time consuming. Instead of blending I found it really just sat on top of my skin like a mask no matter how much or little I used. To finish off this let down it stayed on my face for, at most, 3 hours even when I used setting spray. Needless to say I will not be buying this again."

I used my Real Techniques Stippling Brush and it went o very smoothly. I am in the shade Cappuccino. It doesnt feel greasy or heavy.<br /><br />I think that women arent doing their research properly when they buy foundation. This isnt for oily or acne prone skin! it can build to a medium coverage which is fine for me cuz i have nice looking skin. Yes if you use too much it can look cakey.I used about a pump and a halp for my face and it loos gorgeous. If this is breaking you out it might be something in the formula. Like i said ladies do your research before hand!<br /><br />Also yes it is sparkly, but personally i enjoy it :) makes my face look radiant. I will buy this again!. This works better than my 3 high end foundations! I have only had it on so i cant say how long it last But its been about 2 hours and im not oily yet so thats good :)"

It definitely doesn't have the airbrush effect as it states.. I had to use 2 coats and it still didn't cover as well as my other foundations. It also feels very watery and wet compared to other liquids I've used. It didn't stay on all day either, I had to touch up mid day. But for ligh to medium coverage or someone who doesn't use or need much foundation, I'd say it works well."

I tried putting on layer two to see if I could get better coverage. However my fiance came home and wanted to know why I looked like a disco ball... I guess in certain lights, the make up looks very glittery and shimmery like the vampires, from that franchise.  Needless to say I returned it."

The texture is awful. And the color was so orange-y and very unlike the Mousse, which I loved and on which I received so many compliments about my complexion.

So embarrassing to have my face be such a different color from my neck! Not only that, but it's extremely cakey and enhances all my pores. I've never had much trouble with foundation since I have fairly smooth skin texture and small pores, but this transformed me into something else. I even tried mixing it with other products to salvage the purchase -- bb cream, facial oil, another foundation -- and nothing helped. Even setting it was a lost cause. I will give that it has insane staying power but when it doesn't look good, is it really worth it?<br /><br />You're better off purchasing other drugstore brand foundations over this one.

I find that this foundations apples beautifully to my dry skin after I have moisturized leaving me with a fresh dewy finish and a lightweight feel. However this only happens when applied with a damp beauty blender. When I apply with a brush or fingers it feels quite heavy and appears cakey. <br />It covers my redness and evens out my complexion perfectly however I can still slightly see my freckles pop through if I look closely enough so I would say a light/medium coverage (with only one thin layer applied with beauty blender). This foundation is buildable and can reach a good medium coverage.<br />I don't find that this foundation has particularly great staying power but that is probably because I do not wear a primer or any powder. <br />One thing I am not totally fond of is the teeny tiny glitters in the formula. However they are not glaringly obvious and they do enhance that glow. <br />Despite the spf I do not get any flashback in photography."

Even when I use a primer, finishing powder, AND setting spray - this foundation clumps together and appears in orange blotches on my face and feels sticky. This is just terrible and I've honestly had better results using N.Y.C. brand which is a very cheap brand. This is also filled with glitter.

The pump is not ideal for getting the right amount of product onto hands, and once you do spreading it on your face is a sticky, non-blendable mess. It's like spreading honey onto your face. I switched to this after using another Revlon foundation (Colorstay) for over a decade (because they removed the sunscreen from it and I discovered it contains loads of skin aging parabens) - looking for a smooth, matte and paraben free foundation with spf. This one is a fail - even with powder on top blush/bronzer sticks and goes on blotchy with lines and is impossible to blend, and after a few hours there is a greasy sheen to my whole face. I have never had a problem with shine before - so this was a surprise. Sticks in lines and manages to look cakey while simultaneously being greasy.<br /><br />Come on Revlon! Either take the parabens out of ColorStay and add the spf back in or find a way to get the smooth, matte long lasting finish of colorstay into this product! Also - I have a medium skin tone and the very lightest shade of this foundation (Ivory) is almost too dark for me. Into the bin with this one."

The bottle says they're supposed to be some kind of &quot;light catching pigments&quot;, but it looks like straight- up glitter. You can actually see the sparkles on your face when you put it on. No. Just no."

I've used this the past four years or so and stick with it because of the price and the coverage. Probably could be better quality but it works for me -- probably because I use Tarte Amazonian Powder on top of it."

Definitely not good for mature skin, sits on top of the skin but enhances the lines, very drying. Had sparkles which didn't enhance skin."

I have really bad acne and oily skin. This product stays on except for on my most oily spots even with primer. So if you're not a huge oil pot, this would work great!"

I love it it's easy to apply coming out of a teenager it's good, but the only thing I don't really like about it that the foundation has sparkles I don't not why it does, but u can't really see it. Over  all it's a really great  product for teenagers to use or ones that need to get out the door and this  product would do great."
