"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","nothing","Los Angeles, CA",5,"I agree with the other positive review. I have been using these tweezers since high school and they are awesome. More recently, a girlfriend gave me a much more expensive namebrand pair of tweezers and I was shocked by how &quot;sharp&quot; they were. Sure, they pulled out hairs easily but they also scratched up the delicate skin under my eyebrow.<br /><br />I much prefer these tweezers to any other brand I've tried. I like that they are curved at the ends and although I will admit they aren't super sharp, they get the job done when used correctly and won't pinch or scratch your skin up. And they're always available at a great price."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Fragyl","NC",5,"I have been using the same brand of tweezers since I was 13 years old.  It is always available to buy in many stores worldwide.  It is so easy to use.  The soflty slanted tip does not irritate the skin and helps shape the brow.  The price can't be beat for the quality. You do have to get used to gripping it a certain way, though.  I have tried many other popular brand name tweezers.  They all irritated my skin, painfully pinched my skin, did not grab hair precisely and took too much energy to grip them.  This is the tweezer I shall stick with."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Fresh-faced Chick","Chicago",1,"Bought this at the local store and it has got to be the worst tweezer I have ever used.  Doesn't grip the hair, so it is completely non-functional.  The end is bulbous which does not help you with the task at hand.  Definitely pass."

"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Young Grandma","Sanford, FL",2,"These tweezers do not close properly.  Therefore, do not grasp the individual hairs.  I am disappointed<br />in the product for the price I paid."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Christina","Glen Mills, PA",5,"By far, the best tweezer I've ever used for the price! It gets out all of the stubborn, small hairs that some tweezers cannot get."

"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Elle DriveHer","Vestal, NY",4,"Great product, gets the job done... Sometimes one side of the tweezer's slants hold tighter, but you get used to it once you start using it. Good for the price paid."

"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Ulta faithful","Atlanta",5,"Not all tweezers are made equal.  But these work well to get the fine hairs that are sometimes resistant.  I would definitely recommend this product."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Steph","MA",2,"I really don't like anything about these tweezers... All of the edges are rounded, which makes it hard to get underneath fine or stubborn hairs and the texturized part on the inside is very small so it's completely ineffective at grabbing hairs. I wouldn't recommend using this for your eyebrows because it's next to impossible to get all those tricky hairs."

"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Pagal","Scottsdale, AZ",4,"These tweezers are great for the price!  The edges on the tweezer itself are sharp and can pinch the skin if you're not careful."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","paulaprek","Winter Haven, Fl.",5,"Easy to use, great price. Didn't realize how important it is to keep a tweezers sharp. I hadn't changed mine in quite a while and what a difference this new one made in precision. With the price so good, I will just buy a new one rather than worry about having it sharpened."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-deluxe-tweezer?productId=prod1901094","Jane","New Orleans, LA",5,"I recently lost my Revlon tweezers, which I had owned for about a decade. Due to my satisfaction over the past ten years, I decided to stick with the brand and could not be happier. They're easy to use - flex easily when pinched and slanted tip to control how much you tweeze at once. They come with a lifetime warranty too, which is a plus. Overall, awesome buy."
