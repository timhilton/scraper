"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-micro-fine-tweezer?productId=prod1901185","Liz","Tempe, AZ",4,"No, they are not Tweezerman tweezers but they get the job done. Everyone loses theirs at some point! These are a fine product that work for my once a week usage. They are inexpensive (comparably) and do the job well. If you want more precise tweezers for splinters and such, I would go up a notch."
"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-micro-fine-tweezer?productId=prod1901185","MrsWaffles","Phoenix, AZ",4,"I don't think there is a huge difference between a tweezer like this and one of those $20 ones.  If you use good lighting, have some patience, and step back from the mirror frequently, this will be perfect.  <br /><br />If it's not grabbing, make sure you're using a clean tweezer (I use rubbing alcohol or diluted bleach solution) and that your eyebrows and skin area are clean and not oily."

I lost them and was devestated because even after three tears they never lost their sharpness, which is why I love them.

Unfortunately, I find that these tweezers do not grip hairs very well and work like any other pair of inexpensive drugstore brand tweezers. I think I might invest in an expensive pair since I'm tired of spending $6-$7 on tweezers that aren't very effective. This is an average product."

Substituted another model to replace the one I wanted--without asking me.  Had to send 6 e-mails to get it resolved, and it's STILL on Ulta's website!"

"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-micro-fine-tweezer?productId=prod1901185","Bushy Brows","California",1,"Bought this product begining of March at Ulta excited to use this product because of its thick tip would allow a more firm grasp allowing hair to be fully extracted from the shaft. To my displeasure instead of exracting from the shaft it broke the hair leaving an unattractive stub. The product also does NOT grasp well because hair was slipping from the tweezer. Lastly the product BROKE into two. When looking closer to the tweezers it seemed to be held onto by craft glue stick because the tweezers became plural Tweezerers."

Needless to say, he never got them back! These are great tweezers, and prove able to provide very precise and fine hair removal"

"http://www.ulta.com/slant-tip-micro-fine-tweezer?productId=prod1901185","Brittkitten","Sacramento, CA",5,"My eyebrows grow thick and fast, so I use these tweezers daily. These tweezers are always my go to for my eyebrows. Other tweezers tend to break at the root of the hair follicle, this one always grips the hair no matter how short and removes hair root to tip. ( When they're a new pair that is, they do tend to loose their gripping power after a few months of frequent use. )<br /><br />Overall they are perfect for me. They aren't rounded to where you have no grip and not too sharp to where skin is damaged when you're tweezing short and thick hairs.<br /><br />This isn't really a reflection of the product itself and that's why I rated it perfect, but I didn't really like the packaging. The airtight plastic stuck to the tweezers and made it difficult to remove them.  ( They weren't always packaged like this, I preferred the old hard plastic packaging that gave the product some room and was easily removable. )"
