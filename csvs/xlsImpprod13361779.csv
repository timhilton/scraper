With many colors you can choose from you can wear your eyeshadow from a natural look to a late night smokey look."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","Sugar sugar","Greensboro, NC",1,"I absolutely hated this product. The shadows were cheap and inconsistent. One second it would be okay, the next it would fly off out of nowhere."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","Mik the Cosmo","Colorado Springs Co",4,"I actually love the dark tones in this pallette. You don't need a lot of product to achieve a noticeable color. The lighter colors don't go on super well but I only bought this for the darker colors anyway. I use Urban Decay primer beforehand and the shadow stays on 12+ hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","Amylyn","Mukwonago, wi",5,"You don't need a base for long lasting coverage. Just use the lighter shades and recover with the darker ones"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","Taylor","Georgia",3,"I used Wet n Wild eyeshadow primer as my primer before I applied these eyeshadows. The color isn't very pigmented and you have to pack in a lot of color to get your desired look. It stayed on for the most of the day, a little lighter by the end of the day...but it got the job done."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","Jen","Dallas, TX",1,"I bought the &quot;passionate nudes&quot; palette on a whim while I was in line to check out at my local Ulta. I was so excited because for the price, it seemed like a great deal and had colors similar to ones in more high end palettes. I love finding low cost dupes.<br /><br />However, this palette sucks. Just plain sucks. The colors swatch beautifully, but they just DO NOT BLEND. When used alone you end up with hard lines, when used together you end up with a muddy/chalky mess. My primer (which works well with all of my other eyeshadows) made it even more chalky and difficult to blend out. Without the primer the colors barely show up.<br /><br />I was so disappointed that I thought to return it, but lost my receipt. Usually if I buy hair products or face products that don't work for me I give them to my mom, sister in law, or friends to see if they have better luck. I just threw this in the trash where it belongs."

I would say the colors compliment one another beautifully. The eye shadows are not very easy to blend together. But these are beautiful shades and I would recommend if you don't want to spend $54 on UD."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","CookieMomster","Dublin, CA",4,"This is a great everyday palette and not too bright. Goes on smoothly with a great brush for blending. I bring my own brushes and have found even a sponge applicator works better for the heavier coverage needs."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","Patty","San Diego",3,"I bought this a while ago because of the price. It works great, if you don't have oily eyelids. Lasted for a couple of hours but after that the colors became a gooey mess. I guess if you don't have oily eyelids this would be a good find."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-not-just-nudes-palette?productId=xlsImpprod13361779","New Angel","Wyoming",4,"Nice array of colors for many skin tones. Has most of the colors I need for everyday use. Goes on. Ice, comes with a two sided brush for extra effect."

It was easy to blend, the lighter colors were not very bright and didn't show up very well, but the darker colors were great. I would buy this product again and again. I liked it."

The formula was chalky. The pigmentation and payoff were poor. I was disappointed in the overall quality."
