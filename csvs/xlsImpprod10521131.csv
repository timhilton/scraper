"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Cat","Jersey Shore",5,"This is one of the best eyeliners available.  The brush gives absolute control in application.  I have repeatedly purchased this eyeliner."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","old lady","Holly Lake Ranch, TX",5,"I love how easy it is to use, the color, the look of my eyes."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Unsatisfied","Oklahoma",1,"This eyeliner was such a waste of my money. The tip was way too stiff to the point of not being able to do winged eyeliner. The color was streaky and not dark at all. Would not recommend it to anyone."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","bri","Clarksville, TN",5,"This product glides on smoothly and isn't patchy. Super affordable too"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Cvang0913","Elk Grove, Ca",2,"Very liquidity and takes a while to dry."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Jennifer in Texas","Crosby, Texas",3,"Good color, easy glide, super tiny brush so its great for precision work and wings. Once it dries, though, it flakes right off. Hand swatches proved that it also smudges like crazy. Disappointing for the colorstay line to perform so poorly."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Jazzmine","Sylmar, CA",5,"I've tried soooo many eyeliners, high end and drugstore, and once I came across this one I fell in love. I've literally repurchased this like 10 times, it's sooooo good!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Donna","North Olmsted, Ohio",5,"I love the thin brush.  Makes it easy to put the liner under my eyes as well."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","ktcox","conway ar",5,"Easy to use. Didn't smear. Could build up the thickness of the line very easily."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Grace","Fargo",5,"Amazing liner but it started to burn a little while I was applying it. The burning went away after a minute though."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Makeup lover","Columbia,SC",5,"I love this product and have it in blue, brown, and black.  I love how I can make a very skinny line but also can build thicker lines if I want to.  This eyeliner removes easily with water and gentle makeup remover but stays in place through 12+ hour shifts and sweaty workouts. Love it!<br /><br />My mom uses it as well.  We both have sensitive eyes and wear contacts or glasses and never have any issues"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Amanda","Pittsburgh PA",5,"This is a cheap eyeliner that I think works well! Goes on smooth and it gives you that nice winged look.  Gets the job done."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Eylul","Los angeles",1,"Not only fade through out the day, it is fade from the beginning. I wish I could try that first at the store."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Brenda","Chicago, IL",4,"I love this liner, I love the thinness and how easy it is for me to apply my wing liner. It does get a little messy (smudges) throughout the day (if I'm wearing it all day), it typically starts to do that at the end of my liner or the inner corners. It could be just me but that's why I've experienced, it is a very good product though and I love how it dries matte"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Chloe","Monroe, NY",4,"Any time someone starts using liquid liner it's tough, but the brush on this liner is very fine and precise. So, starting out with a liquid liner like this helped me perfect the craft of a winged look. It's also easy to take off. Although, if I wear it during the school day, I'll find myself coming home with a faded wing and crumbles on my face. This is great for going out for a few hours but not long lasting wear."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Savannah","Florida",5,"I love this eyeliner. It's the only one I use and I never experience any issues."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Sprkly","Elsie, MI",3,"I've used this eyeliner for a long time and for my eye shape and my aging skin, nothing on the market is easier to apply. It really is a fantastic applicator and a nice, smooth formula. Unfortunately, this is not particularly water resistant, and any time my eyes tear up in the slightest, it just disintegrates. It's a lot of work to get your wings perfect, and to have them melt off in an instant really is the worst."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Annie","Boston",4,"This product is awesome. It is easy to apply and I find the applicator allows me to create either a softer line or more dramatic line. I can get a daytime look to night time look with this product. This can be hard to find with liquid liner as some of the applicators aren't designed well enough to get both looks. The color is also great and bold. I just wish the black brown color was more of a cool espresso toned color. I've found the black is great, but I've bought the black brown color and have found that sometimes the color can be more red brown. Hopefully they will make an espresso one. But other than that great product, easy to use, and it has become a staple in my everyday collection"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","EvE","Las Vegas, NV",5,"I randomly chose this product and I love it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Alli","Illinois",4,"I've tried tens of liquid liners including pens, but nothing works with my contours and eyelashes as well as this does. I have naturally long and curled lashes, so it's difficult to apply a lot of liners as they coat my lashes. The skinny felt tip with dip-in liquid seems to work best, though the tip stops absorbing as well after a couple of weeks. I love the matte finish and it lasts most of the day, though tends to bleed into the corner of my tear duct every couple of hours."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Jennifer","Winnie, Tx",2,"It goes on easy but it was a little sharp it poked me a few times or maybe I wasn't applying it right."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","La Sandia","McAllen, Texas",5,"I love this liner. It's the best I've used compared to other liners. I love that it has a thin brush which allows me to make things lines, I usually don't like having thick liner on my eyes. The only thing I noticed the other day I wore it, I laughed a lot which made me cry a bit, my tears reached the liner which made it smudge and run. But overall I really love and enjoy this liner."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","songraven32","Texas",1,"Why do I stray from what I know works?  I got this liner in hopes to extend the wear time of my usual liquid liner.  I was sadly disappointed.  Within a couple of hours it had smudged all over my under eye.  Super disappointed.  Went in the trash within a couple of days."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Merrilee","Missoula, MT",5,"This eyeliner is my favorite because of its smooth application and it works great for all styles. You can make it thin and simple or build it up for a dramatic look. Also you don't have to reapply throughout the day! Of course it takes a lot of practice to accomplish a winged eye, but once you get it down, this liner is perfect for it!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Big Red","Aurora, CO",4,"I've bought both high- and low-end liquid eyeliners, and this is winning out so far. The line is so skinny that it's easy to build it, it lasts a long time, it comes in great colors...I'm pretty satisfied."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Liana Banana","Baltimore",5,"I was searching for an eyeliner that could give me a clean/sharp wing and this one was the best! I was getting a facial done by the gorgeous Nicole at the Canton Crossing location in Baltimore and she had the most perfect makeup so I had to ask what products she used. She said she used this item for her eyeliner and she recommended me to try it! I'm so grateful she did! I LOVE it!!!"

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Emshmem","Georgia",3,"I've been using this product regularly for several years and have finally had to switch. By the end of the workday, this product has totally flaked off at the outer edge of my eye and creates little black dots all along the sides of my face. It's impossible to remove them without ending up with tons of tiny black streaks across my face. Finishing powder and/or setting spray don't help at all."

As long as you're hands off it stays put and lasts well with minimal fading. Though when I first started to do wings with it, I would look in the mirror now and then to one wing totally gone. As I became more careful, the problem went away. Setting spray would also to the trick. When I don't do wings, absolutely no problems!"

I've tried many different pricier brands and always come back to this one. Would not recommend if you tend to touch your eyes a lot or if your eyes water, but if you don't have these issues this eyeliner will last all day and all night."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Coco","Lone Star State",4,"Just started using liquid liner after years of using pencil. Very easy to use. It's so thin it makes it easy to apply as thin or thick as you desire.  It's a strong black color that doesn't fade throughout the day."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Jenniferh","Dallas, tx",3,"Perfect to do winged liner, matte, and glides on easily. The only problem was that throughout the day it would just smear so much because my eyes would get watery sometimes and it would even come off :( I thought all eyeliners did that but then I had tried the wet n wild mega liner in black and it wouldn't smear as much as the revlon skinny liner. I will not be purchasing again."

I really like the felt tip, it helps with precision. It's also quite black and matte. It lasts me all day, as long as I don't accidentally rub it. There is no fading."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Miranda","Grand Rapids, MI",5,"I've used this eyeliner for a few years now and adore it. I prefer the regular brush over the skinny just because while my makeup isn't dramatic, I like having a bolder line. It's a great deal and the bottle lasts for a good three months or so (and that's with everyday use). It's a lasting eyeliner too - after an 8 hour day I might need to touch it up, but I think that's pretty reasonable! I've never had a problem, and I would definitely recommend it."

I love that it's super thin, but that also meant it was a little too &quot;flexible&quot;....I guess I prefer a little sturdier applicator so I can get a super sharp line."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Princess Ali","Portland, OR",5,"I love this eyeliner. It gives a nice, bold line, but is very thin so you can get close to the lash line for a subtle, clean effect. The green color is absolutely gorgeous, and very subtle. This is an amazing deal!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Hannah","Seattle, WA",2,"Bought this because this in Electric Blue because the color looked amazing, and I have to say - the color payoff is fantastic....for the first hour or so. I used this with a primer, and have never had any problems with my other liquid liners. In fact, Revlon's standard pot 'n brush liquid liner has been my standby for years. This on the other hand, smudged and flaked off within two hours. Two hours of going to the grocery store and sitting at home, not rubbing my eyes, etc. I don't know if this also applies for the more standard colors (black, brown) but the blue is just awful. Beautiful, but unfortunately temporarily so."

I use this to define my upper eyelid, and I purchased it in mahogany so it wouldn't be overpowering (black is too much on me). It's less expensive than the Loreal I had been using and I like it a little better. The fine felt tip point is easy to use."

I wanted a thinner line that I could build on and wing out easily. This liner tugs and catches and does not glide across the lid. After starting the line at the inside corner of my eye, that entire portion of the line dissappeared into my tear duct- something I've never had happen with other liquid liners. When I tried to wing it ot it made a horrible choppy line. If tears get anywhere close to the line you'll have a real mess. The finished look was a disaster.  The only good thing I can say was that it had a nice matte finish. I would highly recommend using the Jane liquid liner- a much better budget option."

If you want your brown eyes to pop or would like to accentuate blue eyes, this is a perfect product. I used it on my brown eyes and lined my mom's blue-green eyes and both looks were gorgeous. The color is electric and very trendy. I'm usually a classic/natural style when it comes to make up, but wanted to give this a try...I'm very pleased. The only con was that the applicator is very fine-point, which is okay if you're accustom to working with a thin point. It's a buildable formula so you can go in and keep applying and adjusting your line, which makes up for the thin applicator. I also added a thinner black line closer to the lash line and it muted the intensity of the blue if you are looking for a more demure look."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","msmakeup","USA",3,"The good: The formula of the liner is good and stayed on all day without smudging. It lasted longer than even my favorite liquid liner.<br /><br />The bad: The applicator made it difficult to apply.  The felt tip is very flexible, and it's almost impossible to put enough much pressure on it while applying.  For this reason, the liner doesn't go on smoothly but instead skips and leaves a wobbly line all along the lashline.  I had to go in with a separate liquid liner with a firmer tip to make the line smoother and more precise. It also didn't give me the razor-sharp point on the wing of my cat eye that I wanted. (and that's the whole point of the super-thin tip, right?)"

I love that it's thin so having a skinny line is really easy for those &quot;natural look&quot; days. The only issue I've encountered is that it irritates my eyelids. I've never been allergic to makeup before so I'm not sure if it's me or the product. But I find that it is irritating until the liner is fully dry on my lid.

This creates bold lines, perfect for the winged eye look. However, it must be noted that the brush point is medium - thick sized, so if you're looking to make thin lines on your eyes, you may want to pick something else. For me, I usually like my line a bit thicker for my smaller Asian eyes. It lasts 6 hours, easily and doesn't smudge. Highly recommended."

"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Momma G","Midland Michigan",5,"Best liquid eyeliner that I have purchased in a LONG time.   Goes on smooth and thin.  The staying power is pretty good also.   I would definitely recommend this to friends and family!"
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Em the Drugstore Queen","Pawnee, Indiana",1,"I found that this product was extremely watery and as a result was very tricky to apply. This was a shocker, as Revlon is usually a brand that impresses me in terms of quality. I just really couldn't find any good use for it, as it didn't provide good pigmentation and was such a hassle."
"http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131","Schwam","Milwaukee, WI",3,"I ended up buying this because the original revlon liquid liner wasn't in stock, which happens to be my all-time favorite liner.  When I got this home and opened it up, I was completely caught off guard by the felt pen. It's so long!  It takes a while to get used to....The tip is kind of flimsy so getting a thin, straight line takes twice the patience.  Otherwise you will have eyeliner covering your eyelid.  I also noticed after a few hours that the formula for this specific liner doesn't stay as well.  I looked in the mirror at work and noticed I looked like a raccoon!  Transfered into my creases and everything.  If you're a fan of Revlon, save yourself the hassle and buy the original liquid eyeliner."

Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its colorstay name. It runs and smudges after just a few hours, even with primer."

I'm not sure if it's something in the coloring, but it stings for a few minutes or until it dries."
